44,44,so its from the history that youve given me it sounds like you might have a condition called inflammatory bowel disease which your gp may have mentioned but in order to diagnose you with this we will need to do some further tests and investigations to confirm that diagnosis ,so its youve given me it sounds like have a condition called inflammatory disease your may to you with this some further tests and to confirm,it sounds like you have a condition called inflammatory bowel disease and your doctor may be able to help you with this with some further tests and to confirm the diagnosis

47,47,so there are two main types of inflammatory bowel disease both types are chronic which means that you know you will have them lifelong but we can use medications to improve the symptoms and to try and normalise your bowel habit as much as possible ,so there are means that you will lifelong but to improve the symptoms to try and your,there are many means that you will lose lifelong weight but to improve the symptoms it is important to try and maintain your weight loss
48,48,i dont know at the moment which type of inflammatory bowel disease you have whether its ulcerative colitis or crohns disease and thats why well require a colonoscopy which is a camera test it goes up the tail end and we take some photographs on some biopsies to look at the lining of the bowel to try and decide which type of inflammatory bowel disease you have okay does that sound okay to you ,dont at the moment type inflammatory you have whether or and thats why which a goes the end and some photographs some to at the which inflammatory you have okay does that okay to you,at the moment type of inflammatory bowel disease  you have to decide whether or not and thats why which a picture goes to the end and some photographs some to look at at the beginning of the disease which is inflammatory to you and what does that look like okay to others

67,67,okay and have you ever had bowel problems before this has happened ,and have ever problems this has happened,no patients have ever had any problems with this procedure and none has ever died
68,68,no okay and are you working at the moment or ,and are you the or,however are you managing the pain or discomfort
69,69,um im a student ,um,um
70,70,youre a student okay and i know you havent had any bowel problems in the past have you had any other medical conditions ,student okay and know had any in past have any medical conditions,the student was okay and did not know that she had any previous experience in the past or have any other medical conditions
71,71,um no im just asthmatic ,um im,um im
72,72,and have you noticed any skin changes or joint pains ,have noticed any skin changes or pains,noone have noticed any skin changes or pains
73,73,ive had some rashes on my shins but theyre theyre not itchy or anything they didnt bother me ,ive some on theyre not itchy or anything they didnt bother,ive some on the other hand theyre not itchy or anything they didnt bother
74,74,okay okay and have they sort of come and gone a bit or have they ,they and gone a bit or have,they have been sick and gone a bit or have died
75,75,yeah okay and whats your understanding so far of what investigations youve had ,far of youve,far more than half of the cases were of youve
76,76,um well ive had the camera test and i think theyve done some tests on my stool as well and im just kind of in the dark waiting to hear kind of whats been happening ,ive camera test think done stool as and im of the waiting kind of whats,ive camera test think of it as a stool test and im of the waiting kind of whats
77,77,okay so your stool cultures have been negative so thats the exclude any infective cause of your diarrhoea and obviously youve had your colonoscopy and we took some biopsy results and so that sort of confirms the diagnosis of something something called ulcerative colitis which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease i dont know if youve heard of those terms before ,okay so stool cultures have thats infective cause your diarrhoea and obviously and took biopsy results and that sort the diagnosis of something something called colitis which a of inflammatory know if youve heard terms,if stool cultures have shown that thats an infective cause of your diarrhoea and obviously the gastroenterologist and microbiologist took the biopsy results and that sort of confirmed the diagnosis of something something called ulcerative colitis which is a form of inflammatory bowel disease you know if youve heard the terms
78,78,ive heard my granddad having it but i havent i dont know much about it ,my granddad it but i havent dont know,my granddad had it but i havent know why
79,79,okay so its sort of chronic inflammatory disease affecting predominantly the bowel but it can affect other parts of the body like skin joints sometimes even the eyes um but thats more unusual um so we were planned to start you on some steroids initially to try and reduce the inflammation down and also medication called pentasa which is a maintenance therapy um so have you had any steroids at all yet from your gp or ,okay its sort inflammatory predominantly but it the body joints even the um but thats so we to you steroids initially to and reduce medication called which a so have any steroids all yet gp or,it affects the body joints and even the um but thats not so we want to send you steroids initially to try and reduce the medication called gp which is a steroid so you dont have any steroids all over the world yet gp or placebo
80,80,no okay so well get you started on those and then arrange to see you back in clinic in a couple of weeks time to see how youre getting on okay have you got any questions youd like to ask about that or ,so well get started and then arrange to back clinic a couple of time youre okay have got questions like ask about,then you arrange to come back to the clinic in a couple of weeks and by that time youre okay and have got questions like what to ask about
81,81,um so this maintenance treatment like how long do you think i need to be on that for ,um so this treatment how long i need to be that,um so far this treatment has been well tolerated how long i need to be able to continue that
82,82,so everyones a little bit different in terms of how their disease course progresses um some people are you know very well controlled on therapy for for years and some people have a bit more of a rough ride and require other medications to be added in as well so well keep you on it for you know at least the first year or so and then well review things after that and but also with colitis is a chronic long term condition that youll have for the rest of your life and have to sort of learn to live with as well but theres lots of support available for you as well so ,so little bit in of how disease course are you well for some people a of a be added in as well keep on for know least and after and but is chronic condition youll have for of your and have live with as well lots of support as well,however in terms of how disease course are you well for some people a little bit of a history will be added in as well as keep on caring for others to know at least before and after the diagnosis and treatment but if it is a chronic condition youll have a good prognosis for the rest of your life and have good quality of life to live with and to have lots of medical support and well nourished children

104,104,no its been okay my rheumatoids quite well controlled as well yeah,no its okay my rheumatoids quite,no matter what its okay to treat my rheumatoids quite often
105,105,and what medication are you taking for that,and what medication taking that,and what is the risk of medication taking for that

110,110,okay and whats your weight being doing,whats weight being,whats the weight loss being achieved
111,111,um ive lost a wee bit of weight actually,um wee bit weight actually,um a wee bit of weight loss actually
112,112,yeah okay,okay,okay
113,113,and so do you have any sort of ideas what might be going on yourself or any concerns at this point,so you have sort ideas what going yourself or any at this,so you have sort of vague idea of what is going on but you are not going to incriminate yourself or any of your colleagues at this time
114,114,yeah im a bit worried just because its been so well controlled for few years now im worried that my is my adalimumab stopped working or is something else causing my symptoms,im bit just well for now im worried is my stopped something else causing symptoms,im a bit nervous but just as well for now im worried that my symptoms have stopped because of something else causing the symptoms
115,115,or what do you think,or what do you,or what do you think
116,116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,yeah so few things that might on know tests so them it the kind lost its effectiveness we can for a blood test to for the of the in your also could antibodies drug well,yeah so few things that might depend on these tests so it is the kind of test that has lost its effectiveness that we can call for a blood test to be used for the diagnosis of the antibodies in your blood and also could detect antibodies to the drug as well
117,117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,can make it can check that the is because had surgery the can sometimes how something the bile reabsorbed um and sometimes cause got levels of your thats quite to check for well,although it can be difficult to check that the bile is reabsorbed because of the surgery the surgeon can sometimes show how something in the gi tract may have been degradable and that some of it got elevated levels of your hormones that are quite important to know for well
118,118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,of you whether your actually as well so the thing well to a faecal in probably done before,of course it depends on whether your faecal mucosa is actually there as well so the whole darned thing is well known to us that a proper fecal biopsy in children is probably done before
119,119,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes,just cheque and bowel we might at and think about making changes,just as the cheque and bowel sounds we might look at these findings and think about making changes
120,120,do you have any questions about all of that quite a lot of information,do you about all quite a lot of information,do you know about all this and quite a lot of information
121,121,yeah its okay if you do need to change my medication like what would be the next step,its okay if need to change like the next,its okay if they need to change like the next day
122,122,so theres a few different options so there is a medication called and infliximab which is similar to adalimumab or we might look at you know switching you to a completely different drug um as well also also called the biologic different works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab but yeah i think first of all well get some up to date tests on first might need to get a ct scan or also an mri scan of your small bowel just to have a look and see if theres any inflammation in the bowel that might be you know causing your symptoms,theres few different options there is called and similar we look at you know you to a completely as also different in different in bodies it called vedolizumab but yeah i all up date on first need to get a scan or also an mri scan to have look and see if theres might be know your,there is a new drug called vedolizumab and similar to it we look at it and if you know you are allergic to a completely different drug as well as different drugs in different parts of the bodies it is also called diclofenacv and also known to be different in other body types it has a similar name called rygbv but all up to date on the first day you need to get a ct scan or also an mri scan to have a good look and see if theres might be able to know your allergy
123,123,and i had surgery before my treatment wasnt working do you think thats a possibility in the future,i before my working do think thats the future,we before my working day do not think thats the case in the future
124,124,so i mean its always possible we have to always keep it at the back of our mind and hopefully they you know we can try and work out whats going on and that do something medically but yeah ofcourse we have to always think about surgery is as a possibility,so its possible we have keep at the of mind and hopefully they we try out going on and do medically ofcourse always think surgery is as a possibility,we have to keep these patients at the forefront of our mind and hopefully they will understand that we try out what is going on and do it medically ofcourse we always think surgery is as a possibility
125,125,yeah but hopefully not,but hopefully,but hopefully not soon
126,126,yes definitely okay,yes,yes
127,127,is that okay,is,is this the first report of a pilot study

151,151,yeah i had ive got asthma but never really bothers me sometimes i have to take my blue inhaler ,yeah had asthma never really sometimes i have to take blue inhaler,yeah i had asthma but never really asthma and sometimes i have to take a blue inhaler
152,152,okay and any other medications that youre taking ,and that youre,and that is why youre here
153,153,no any allergies ,any,any problem was solved
154,154,um no ,no,no deaths occurred
155,155,and have you got any family history of any significant medical conditions ,family conditions,family and medical conditions
156,156,yes my my grand my grand dad had ostrich colitis ,grand my grand had,my great grand daughter had died and my grand grand son had been born
157,157,and any other anyone else in the family with inflammatory bowel disease ,and any else the family inflammatory disease,and any else in the family with inflammatory bowel disease
158,158,no i dont think so ,i dont so,it is so simple
159,159,okay so so far youve had some investigations done so weve taken some samples of your stool to make sure that theres no infection there and you also had a colonoscopy a couple of weeks ago did anyone go through the results with you ,so far had so to make sure that no infection there and had a couple of anyone go the,so far we had done so to make sure that no infection was there and have had a couple of patients who refused to let anyone go to the hospital
160,160,no not really no ,not,not much is known about this phenomenon
161,161,so that we took some biopsies when we did the colonoscopy and it looks like you do have something called ulcerative colitis okay so they were in keeping with with that condition i dont know how much you know about inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis ,so that some biopsies when colonoscopy and like do have colitis in keeping with condition i know how you know about inflammatory bowel or ulcerative,when colonoscopy and colon biopsies like this do not reveal that patients do have ulcerative colitis in keeping with this condition i know how you know about inflammatory bowel disease  or the presence or absence of an inflammatory or inflammatory colic
162,162,i know wee bit because i have seen my grandma my grandfather had it i dont know i dont know a lot ,i bit because i have seen my grandfather had dont dont,in a bit because i have seen my grandfather  he had died and i dont know why he dont die
163,163,okay so its what we call a chronic condition so its something that youre going to have life long unfortunately um but its a condition that we can control very well with medications in the vast majority of people so to start with well start you on a course of steroids i dont think youve had any from your gp yet but that should help to sort of calm down the inflammation in your bowel and then well get you started on some other maintenance therapies im going into details of that on at the next consultation do you have any questions about that just at the moment ,okay so we call a condition its that youre going long unfortunately its we control very well medications vast of to you on of dont any from your gp should help to calm down the inflammation in and then well you started some other maintenance im going next do you just the,we call it a condition that youre going to have for a long time unfortunately its we control very well with medications and vast amounts of attention to you on the part of the gp and dont take any medication from your gp which should help to calm down the inflammation in the stomach and then as well as if you started some other maintenance im going next do you just stop the medication
164,164,um so um yeah sorry its just lot to take in ,um um sorry its lot to take in,um um sorry its a lot to take in
165,165,so how long will be on these steroids for is that for lifelong ,how long these for that,how long can these be used for that purpose
166,166,so the steroids are normally just for 8 to 68 weeks until the inflammation has has died down ,so the 8 to until the has,so the patient is admitted to hospital until the diagnosis has been made
167,167,and hopefully your bowel have it should be going back to normal,and hopefully bowel have it should going back to,and hopefully bowel habits have improved and it should be going back to normal
168,168,and you should know its less blood as well if that doesnt happen with the steroids then we would want to know about that in case we need to do some further investigations but in terms of maintenance therapies that we talked about you will be on those for longer term and often people are on them lifelong or certainly for years depending on the course of their disease ,know its blood as if doesnt with steroids then we would want about case some further investigations but in terms maintenance that we about will be on longer and often them for years depending the course of their disease,knowing its blood count as well as if it doesnt correlate with steroids then we would want to know about this case in some further investigations but in terms of maintenance that we are hearing about patients who will be on steroids for longer periods and often have them for years depending on the course of their disease
169,169,okay so and well also have to arrange some surveillance colonoscopy for you as well just to make sure that you dont develop other conditions that are associated with inflammatory bowel disease okay ,okay well also surveillance for well just make sure that dont develop associated disease okay,also surveillance for other diseases as well just make sure that they dont develop associated disease okay
170,170,so well arrange it to see you back in clinic in about six weeks time for a review thank you,so well arrange it to see you in about weeks review you,so we will well arrange it to see you in about two weeks to review you

197,197,um yes ive got ive got arthritis and ive also got hay fever and asthma as well ,um yes ive got ive hay fever and as well,um yes ive got ives fever and diarrhoea as well
198,198,and any other medications that youre on other than the adalimumab  ,and any medications other adalimumab,and any medications other than adalimumab
199,199,so i take i take some diclofenac thats for my my arthritis ,take i some thats for my,take i some suggestions that are suitable for my study
200,200,all right okay ,okay,okay
201,201,it helps my pain ,my,myocardial infarction
202,202,are you taking that regularly ,are taking regularly,are taking aspirin regularly
203,203,id say so ,id say so,id did not say so
204,204,have you noticed any stomach upset with that ,upset,upset patients
205,205,i mean well i suppose i have to have this abdominal pain in my tummy so i dont know could that be could be connected to that,i suppose to have pain my so know could could connected to that,we know that it could be connected to that
206,206,yeah possibly so we do find people here on long term nonsteroidal medications like diclofenac that kind of upset your stomach especially if youre not taking omeprazole or a medication like that with it so we need to be might need to address that do you have any insight or ideas about what might be causing your symptoms preferably the diarrhoea and the weight loss ,so we do find people diclofenac that kind youre omeprazole or a like with it we to that have any insight or ideas be causing preferably the and,although we do not find people taking diclofenac that kind of youre omeprazole or a combination like that with it we would like to find that people that have any insight or ideas that might be causing problems preferably in the gastrointestinal tract and liver
207,207,and well i suppose i just assumed thats my crohns with that was being watery but i dont know about but do you think it could be anything else ,and i just my that was watery dont about do anything else,in my case that was watery i dont about do anything else
208,208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,yeah theres a different could be i a for quite fact not to shortly after were so we need to look that i in the instance will get off to check need send samples your sure no infection also off a test called calprotectin to look for inflammation in that to the disease on what those are decide whether you another up the tail end to have look at the lining bowel so doing that the how sound to,we could be in a position for quite a long time in fact not to go to hospital until shortly after the diagnoses were made so we need to look that i in the instance of this case will get off to check for infection and then need send samples to make sure no infection is also detected so that we can send off a test called calprotectin to try for inflammation in that area to diagnose the disease depending on what those are and decide whether you want another test up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so doing that will help the patient to know how to sound to the doctors
209,209,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in ,yeah mean thats all yeah i be getting and things quite a lot to in,yeah mean thats all yeah i be getting older and things are quite a lot easier to deal with in adulthood
210,210,of course,of course,of course there was no major complication
211,211,but yeah i understand ,but,but not all patients
212,212,any other questions ,any other questions,any other questions were answered
213,213,yeah do you think i need to change my medication to something else ,you i change my to else,if i change my mind to something else
214,214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,one of can to check medication in your blood the adalimumab or checking antibodies the level the drug but at you adalimumab until bit more information about whats on,one of the options can be to check the medication level in your blood at the level of adalimumab or checking antibodies in the blood level from the drug but at least at first you have to continue taking the antifungal drug and the other can keep you on the regimen of antireflux anticoagulants and anticholinergic drugs until a bit more information about whats going on
215,215,okay you think i might need more surgery ,okay might more surgery,okay it might be more effective than conventional bariatric surgery
216,216,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay ,depends bit on investigations might know what they might to go on and get scan bowel to have a there arent any points in the bowel like last if thats the case then we might look at surgery but a further down line for a,depends a bit on the investigations but we might know what they might need to go on and get a scan of the bowel to have a definite diagnosis if there arent any points in the small bowel like last time and if thats the case then we would look at surgery but a further down line for a definitive diagnosis is needed
217,217,thank you,thank you,thank you

248,248,yeah my moms got ulcerative colitis ,yeah moms colitis,yeah moms colitis
249,249,okay and is she well with that or is she on medications ,okay is she that or she on,okay it is possible that he or she is on antibiotics
250,250,okay and so whats your understanding of of whats been going on so far ,so whats your understanding going on,so whats your understanding of what is going on
251,251,so im worried that ive got colitis as well ,im that ive colitis well,immunoglobulin a is a drug that is associated with ive colitis as well
252,252,does your moms experience make you more concerned about that or ,does your you more,does your diet affect you more
253,253,a little bit because she sometimes has a flare ups ,ups,six patients  had hiccups
254,254,and that could be quite unwell with that so im quite worried but thats whats going to happen to me as well ,that could be unwell with so im quite but happen me,im not quite sure what could happen but it did happen to me
255,255,okay so at the moment we need to take some stool cultures from you i think youve had some sent but we need to send a couple more just to exclude any infection we also need to arrange an urgent colonoscopy for you so that im sure your mom have had one of those before so its basically a camera test it goes into your bowel and has a look and we take photographs and take biopsies to try and diagnose you with what we think is inflammatory bowel disease okay there are a couple of different types of inflammatory bowel disease so one is called ulcerative colitis like your mom has and the other one is called crohns disease and so they are similar in many ways but there are key differences in terms of how we manage people so thats what well do at the moment for today well start you on something called pentesia which is to try and help reduce any inflammation in the bowel and then once we get a formal diagnosis from biopsies and things well hopefully aim to start you on some steroids to reduce the inflammation okay does that sound okay ,the we need to take some stool cultures from you i youve had some we need to a couple more just to any also to urgent colonoscopy that mom had one of those before so a a look we and take to and diagnose you with is inflammatory are a couple different of inflammatory disease one is ulcerative colitis the other one crohns they are similar in many but there are key manage what do moment for well on something called which is and help reduce inflammation bowel and we diagnosis from things well aim start on steroids reduce inflammation does that,we need to take some stool cultures from you i youve had some and we need a couple more just to diagnose any disease and also to refer you to urgent colonoscopy that mom had one of those before so we will take a look at you and take the time to identify and diagnose you with what is inflammatory bowel disease  there are a lot of different types of inflammatory disease one is ulcerative colitis the other is crohns disease they are similar in many ways but there is a key to manage what do we do at the moment for well on steroids which is known to help reduce inflammation of the bowel and
256,256,yeah that sounds okay ,sounds,sounds
257,257,do you have any questions about all of that or ,do you have any all of,do you have any knowledge of all of these procedures
258,258,so do i have to be on medications forever ,have on medications forever,have been on these medications forever
259,259,so its very dependent on the patient or on the person who some people respond very well to initial therapy and they might remain well for years with a normal bowel habit and will kind of see you or speak to you from clinic you know maybe every six months for a year to see how youre getting on and decides if you can come off medication so some people stay on medication lifelong and some people manage to come off it ,so dependent the patient or on person some respond well to initial and might years a normal habit and kind of speak to you clinic you every six months year how and decides off medication some on lifelong some people manage to come off,some people respond well to initial medication and might for years maintain a normal habit and kind of speak to you clinic and you every six months for one year how and when one person decides to come off medication some people decide on lifelong medication others manage to stay off
260,260,okay that sounds fine ,okay that,okay that is true
261,261,okay great ,okay,okay
262,262,so ill go and arrange your series of investigations,go your series of investigations,go through your series of investigations
263,263,hello my names amy im one of the gastroenterology doctors at the ibd clinic can i take your name ,one of gastroenterology at can name,one of the centers of gastroenterology at the university can name it
264,264,its rachel brown ,its,its use is controversial
265,265,nice to meet you rachel so i know that youre quite well known to our clinic so we see every year or so but were seeing you slightly earlier than usual can you tell me why that is whats been going on ,to meet you rachel so i know quite well our we every year or so were usual is whats going on,so i know quite well our family we visited every year or so and were usual but there is whats going on
266,266,so for the past kind of probably two months i noticed my bowels are going more frequently and its lot more watery than it used to be ,for past kind of probably i noticed are going frequently and lot more used,for the past kind of years probably i noticed that the devices are going more frequently and a lot more commonly used
267,267,i havent noticed any blood but just the frequency is starting to become quite concerning ,noticed any but starting to,she had not noticed any changes but was starting to feel better
268,268,okay and if so have you noticed any blood at all or ,okay and blood,okay and blood transfusion
269,269,no no blood but ive just been feeling very tired all the time quite lethargic ,no but ive all time lethargic,no ive at all time points was lethargic
270,270,okay and have you been to see your gp about any of this ,okay have you been gp about any of,however have you been contacted by gp about any of this
271,271,okay if you had any blood check recently or ,you had any,no patient had any complications
272,272,okay and so just tell me i know you are on adalimumab and how it has been for you ,okay and me adalimumab and how been you,okay and me have been taking adalimumab and how has it been treating you
273,273,so initially i felt that the adalimumab really made a big improvement kind of get my life back yeah now its i think its wearing off ,initially that the a big kind get my back yeah think wearing,initially it was a big kind of pain in my back and yeah we think of wearing a belt
274,274,okay and are you pretty good at taking it ,okay you pretty good,okay you were doing pretty good
275,275,yeah im good at taking it  i always take it at every fortnight ,yeah i always take fortnight,yeah i always take a fortnight off
276,276,okay and any abdominal pain ,okay and any,no serious adverse events occurred and there were no deaths in any patient
277,277,yeah i do get some pain but ive had that for quite a long time now ,yeah some ive had that a,yeah some ive had that problem before and after a bariatric surgery
278,278,its been getting any worse recently ,its been getting,its been getting worse
279,279,okay and any other medical conditions that you have ,medical conditions you have,medical conditions you have
280,280,so ive got arthritis and hay fever and asthma as well ,so hay,so hay
281,281,okay and are you on any medications for those things ,okay are you on medications,however are you on medications
282,282,just ansaid for my arthritis ,just ansaid for my,just ansaid for my case
283,283,okay are you taking those regularly or ,are you regularly or,are you regularly receiving or receiving medications
284,284,just kind of as when i need them i dont really like taking them ,of when need i dont really like,of course when the need arises i dont really like it
285,285,sure okay and do you have any sort of questions at the moment as to what might be going on or ,sure okay have as might or,surely they will be okay if they have as many complications as might be expected or expected
286,286,what do you think is causing my symptoms of the moment ,do think my symptoms the,do you think my symptoms are related to the gastrointestinal symptoms
287,287,so theres a few different things that could be going on one of them could be that as you sort of alluded to yourself that you might be coming your bodys not responding as well to the adalimumab so one of the things that well do today is check the levels of the drug in your body to make sure that your body is handling it as it should be it could also be that your crohns disease is a bit more active than usual so one of the things that we can do for that is check up fecal calprotectin which you will probably have had done before ,theres different things that could be on them could sort yourself you coming responding well to one that is check of in your make sure that body handling it could also your is more usual one of things we can that which will have had before,theres different things that could be done on them which could sort yourself out from one that you are coming to responding well to and to another that is a check of the quality of life in your body make sure that body handling is good it could also be that your life is more usual and one of things we can focus on that which will have had a negative impact before
288,288,and thats just a stool test to check the inflammation we also need to send some samples off to make sure theres no infection there as well and well do some bloods to make sure you are not a knee make or needing any sort of a placement of your electrolytes okay what how does that sound to you ,and thats just a test to check we need to some samples off to make no as and well do bloods to make not a knee make or needing a placement of your okay what how that you,we need to take some samples off to make no conclusions as and as well as do bloods not show a knee or hip needing a placement of your foot okay what how does that work
289,289,you know that sounds fine im just worried that ill need to change my medication and ive been getting on quite well with the adalimumab ,know that im just that need to change my medication and getting on well,knowing that im just a patient that needs to change my medication and getting on well
