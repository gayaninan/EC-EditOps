115,or what do you think,or abut do you think,or what do you think
116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,pah au theres a few brings batt  be owing on to know we only need ado Pavlov different tests so one of them right bit could batt the adalimumab bind of aust  effectiveness ditch sometimes happens and we can test for that ai doing a budde best do check for the level of the drug in your body and also sometimes ado cushion could develop somebody's against the drug as well,however there are a few brings that we would be owing on to know we only need two different tests so one of them right it could be that the adalimumab has no evidence of australian effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also sometimes we could develop antibodies against the drugs as well
117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and which can make it  portrayal so we can easily check that the uther thing is that  youve had surgery in the bast bum that can sometimes  how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes can cause gonorrhea if youve got high levels of bile salts in abor impolitely bowel  but  buck quite easy do check cor us well,and which can make it easy so we can easily check that the other thing is that if youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes cause how something called the bile salts get absorbed um and sometimes can cause diarrhoea if we´ve got high levels of biliary salts in our bowel tract but it is quite easy to check for us as well
118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,and of course ado resourcefulness need  obscure also think about whether your adorees is  flaring up as well au Lapp the consciously other bring well  do ms a faecal in which youve probably done ashore,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well as the other well if it is a faecal disease in which youve probably done before

206,yeah possibly so we do find people here on long term nonsteroidal medications like diclofenac that kind of upset your stomach especially if youre not taking omeprazole or a medication like that with it so we need to be might need to address that do you have any insight or ideas about what might be causing your symptoms preferably the diarrhoea and the weight loss , we do bind people here  long term nonsteroidal medications like batt kind of upset abor stomach especially if  not taking or a medication bike omnipotent that with bodily it so ab need  be might need to abscess that do you have any insight or ideas 'bout come what  be  your symptoms preferably the diarrhoea and the weight loss,we do find here that long term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications like that kind of upset more stomach especially if you are not taking or taking a medication that combines that with bodily it so we need to be aware that you might need this process that do you have any insight or suggestions about what might be causing your symptoms preferably the diarrhoea and the weight loss

208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,au yeah i  theres a ado different brings biltong it  i  Eucharist that youve not add a colonoscopy for bight some time  pact not said do you shortly after  birr drizzle diagnosed so might need do book scurry at repeating  white think in  first instance will get some budde  off do  anticipatory prehistoric  mamey we need do  alum samples of  stool off to make  theres no infection and shifting also send boff a special test called  calprotectin  to look for  liturgy in your bowel batt might be related to the crohns disease i think ascending on what those are adel maybe decide  whether  need brother camera test up up the bail end to halve a  assort at the lining gov the bowel so i think thats SCLK thats abut we are doing just at that the reject how  sound to you,au yeah i think it is important that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time and not said to you shortly after symptoms were diagnosed so you might need to look at repeating the white paper and think in the first instance will get some blood taken off to confirm inflammatory bowel disease
209,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in ,yeah i yes pah France thats thats all right pah i  pah i didnt really  could be getting aul these tests and things quite a cot woodsy to ache in,yeah i yes i did pah i didnt really think i could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in
210,of course,of course,of course
211,but yeah i understand ,cut extraction yeah i understand,cut extraction yeah we understand

213,yeah do you think i need to change my medication to something else , do defeasible think i need to change my medication to twentysomething else,do i need to change my medication to something else
214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,so  of the brings we ahn do to check the level of the medication in your budde called the adalimumab carlile checking the  and  level of the drug bat the moment  wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just abril weve  memorialise a bed bit more information 'bout mythical whats ,so because of this we can do to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile  checking the safety and tolerability levelof the drug at the moment of administration wouldnt change you from your previous regimen just until we have given a little more information about whats going on
215,okay you think i might need more surgery ,okay think y bight need more surgery,okay we think he might need more surgery
216,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay ,well 'gain protractedly depends a little bit  investigations extravagance might you know depending on what they aglo we might to go  and get mri scan of  bowel just to have a look and make sure abair arant any other joints narrowing in the bowel like you  bast time if thats the case then we might need do  at perjury cut thats a lot further gown the line a moment 'kay,well it depends a little bit on investigations what might you know depending on what they show we might need to go in and get mri scan of the bowel just to have a look and make sure there are any other joints narrowing in the small bowel like you would expect at surgery but at this time if thats the case then we would need do further investigations but thats a lot further down the line at a moment theykay
