1517,1517,um the reason i say that is because the history is very suggestive of it given your mum and your sister also migraines i think its something for us to think about,um say that is because history is very it given your mum and migraines think something about,um say that is because family history is very important and it gives your mum and father migraines reason to think something about it
1518,1518,um now im not saying its gonna keep happening but it may just be a one off but its certainly worth treating it today stronger analgesia or painkillers,um its keep it may be a but its worth treating today stronger analgesia,um has its own complications to keep in mind it may be a safe procedure but its worth treating today with stronger analgesia
1519,1519,um now moving forward we have some options which we can discuss uh you tried the ibuprofen now my only worry is im not sure whether youre taking the correct dose you can take up to two tablets three times a day,um now moving some can you ibuprofen now my is im not whether youre you take up two three a day,um now moving some patients can take ibuprofen now but my question is im not whether youre able to take up two or three a day

1522,1522,ok and i think its certainly worth looking into that so i can give you a prescription for that today um with regards to um the next few days it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out whats you know if theres any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse,and i its looking into that so i can give a for today um next days it may be worth keeping a headache so we can try and work out whats know any triggers which could be headaches to become,and i am looking into that so i can give a reason for today um and the next days it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out whats the cause and know any triggers which could be causing headaches to become more frequent

1913,1913,um what i think we should do is i think you should be on some anti inflammatory medication in the in the first instance,what i think we i you should on some inflammatory medication in the in the,what i think we i suggest that you should be on some inflammatory medication in the future in order to improve the quality of life of the patients
1914,1914,and as well as that what i would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of uh causes of joint swelling k,and as as what would to do is some tests check other of causes k,as such what would be advisable to do is some tests to check other types of causes of k
1915,1915,so um what were going to do is were going to arrange some um blood test forms to be sent out to your house and therell be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done,so um what were to do is were to some blood test forms be to house therell be within pack about where to go to get those tests done,what we were aiming to do was to provide some blood test forms to be delivered to our house and therell be discussion within the pack about where to go to get those tests done
1916,1916,and that will involve you um having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers infection rheumatological antibodies,having some markers infection rheumatological,having some markers of infection rheumatological evaluation
1917,1917,so well do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well ok um,so a full screen check for things as ok um,so a full screen check for things as ok um
1918,1918,the time frame for that will be um the results will come back to us after about five or six days um,the time frame that will um the will come back to or six days,the time frame that will be um the patient will come back to us five or six days later
1919,1919,from now but it may take time for the form to come out to you and if you get the form get the blood tests done straight away by the time that were expecting result back you know one or two days after that were looking maybe six days,from now may take time for form you if you the form the blood tests done straight away the that expecting back you or after that maybe days,it may take time for the form to be filled out and if you fill out the paper form the blood tests should be done straight away in the time that the doctor is expecting back you or after that maybe days

1924,1924,um and uh your your joint doesnt look like that,joint,joint endoscopy
1925,1925,however if your the elbow was to become very red very painful uh and the redness was to spread or become uh you know more intense then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible,however if your the to become very painful uh and the to spread or become uh you know intense then you need to phone or a video appointment one us as soon as possible,however if your pain continues to become very painful uh and the symptoms continue to spread or become more intense then you need to make a phone or a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible

2397,2397,ok fantastic brilliant ok um,ok um,ok um
2398,2398,uh john based on um how you look how youre talking to me and how youre breathing and the appearance and your wrist,based on how look how youre talking to me and how breathing and appearance and,based on how we look how youre talking to me and how breathing and appearance are altered and altered
2399,2399,um i dont feel that youre having a an an a life threatening uh allergic reaction,um i feel youre having an life allergic reaction,um i feel youre having an allergic reaction
2400,2400,now its very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite its uh its a localised um uh inflammatory reaction that um is normal and that immediate reaction that redness and that maybe slight swelling is usually temporary,now very normal to have a rash you have some of uh its a um uh reaction that normal and that immediate reaction redness and that maybe slight swelling is usually,when you have some kind of uh its a um uh reaction that is normal and that immediate reaction is redness and swelling that maybe a slight swelling is usually seen
2401,2401,what were worried about is when someone has um compromise of their breathing so you mentioned breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip thankfully i cant see any of that right now,were worried about is when um of their so you breathing difficulties you mentioned your lip cant see any now,when um of their own so you had breathing difficulties you mentioned your lip but cant see any now
2402,2402,but thats the most urgent and most pressing thing that wed be watching out for,thats most and pressing thing wed out,thats the most common and pressing thing wed out
2403,2403,given that it hasnt happened initially its unlikely to happen later ok we so we have like a stage one and stage two reaction for these types of bites,given that it hasnt its unlikely to later ok we have like a stage and stage reaction these of bites,given that it hasnt been proven its unlikely to develop later ok we have like a stage and stage reaction to these types of bites
2404,2404,and usually if youre gonna have the reaction it will happen straight away,and if will,however if these results persist they will be controversial
2405,2405,so we may be coming out of the danger zone now its um but im just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens so for example,so we may coming out of the danger zone now its but going warn you about what signs and are for example,so we may be coming out of the danger zone now its safe but we are going to warn you about what signs and symptoms are present for example
2406,2406,right ok so when did this bee sting or bee bite occur,right ok did this or bee bite occur,right ok did this or any other bee bite occur
2407,2407,you would have swelling of the lips difficulty breathing you might have something called stridor which is an inspiratory sound that you when youre trying trying to breathe it makes like a rasping sound like this ok,would swelling the lips breathing might something called stridor which is an you when trying rasping,would swelling of the lips impair breathing and might be caused by something called stridor which is an alarm to you when trying to stop rasping
2408,2408,thankfully you dont have anything like that right now it seems to me like this is a localised allergic reaction,thankfully right now it seems to me a localised allergic,thankfully right now it seems to me to be a localised allergic reaction
2409,2409,however if anything changes if anything deteriorates either make an appointment with us or go straight to a and e,if anything if either appointment with or straight to a and,if there was anything suspicious if either an appointment was made with a dietitian or straight to a gastroenterologist and anesthesiologist
2410,2410,um uh and in some cases if its if its uh progressing rapidly its better to go straight to a and e rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us ok,um uh some cases its if its progressing its better to to a and e rather to wait a booked appointment with us,um uh in some cases its better to go to a doctor and an e rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us
2411,2411,what id like you to do now is id like you to try and take some antihistamines,what id you to do now like you to and some antihistamines,we would like you to do now like to take some ibuprofen and some antihistamines
2412,2412,so you can buy them over the counter you can get piriton or chlorphenamine and you can take one tablet four milligrams um up to about six times a day ok,so you can buy them over the counter you get or chlorphenamine and you take four um times day,over the counter you get acetaminophen or chlorphenamine and you take four um times a day
2413,2413,or you can just take a one a day one whichever is your preference thats thats absolutely fine theres no no issue that should be enough to control this,you just one day one whichever is your thats thats absolutely theres no issue should be to this,if you just have one day one of whichever day is your day that thats absolutely theres no issue you should be able to resolve this issue
2414,2414,um if the redness in your arm spreads and you it feels hot or you you know you have signs of any localised infection,um if in arm spreads and you or you you have signs of localised infection,um if the lesion in the arm spreads and you or you not you have signs of localised infection
2415,2415,we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic,we need think about other like antibiotic,we need to think about other options like antibiotic therapy
2416,2416,and like i said if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing thats urgent and we need to process that action needs to be taken urgently,like i said if anything deteriorates in of your breathing and to that action to be taken,like i said if anything deteriorates in the course of your breathing and fails to improve that action needs to be taken
2417,2417,right ok um and your your lips dont seem swollen to me right now but do they which can you show me with your finger where you feel its swollen,and lips seem to right now but do which you show with where you feel its swollen,the lips seem to be tender right now but do not show any signs which you show with tenderness where you feel its swollen
2418,2418,did you have any other um queries or was there anything else that youre worried about,did you have other or anything else about,did you have any other complaints or concerns or anything else about the procedure
2419,2419,yeah thats thats over the yeah over the counter you dont need to any chemist will have it you dont need a prescription for that yeah its probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to get it via prescription,yeah thats the the counter dont need to chemist will it dont a for yeah probably cheaper the counter actually get via prescription,yeah thats the reason the counter dont need to be searched by a chemist will it dont require a prescription for drugs yeah it is probably cheaper than the pharmacy counter to actually get medicines via prescription
2420,2420,ok um now um uh on the basis of what youve told me i dont think you need any allergy testing i think this is just a a straightforward localised reaction to a an insect bite,ok uh on the youve told me dont think you any just a straightforward reaction a an bite,ok uh on the other hand youve told me dont think you have any symptoms just a straightforward reaction to a bite
2421,2421,however if it was to happen that you know this youre youre having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non specific rashes we might need to think about blood testing i dont think were at at that moment yet ok,however if it to that you know youre having these or rashes we might to think about blood testing i think were at that moment ok,however if it happens to you that youre having these or other rashes we might need to think about blood testing and i think we were at that moment ok
2422,2422,so uh but thats something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent pattern,uh but thats something in in case this recurrent,uh but thats not something that can be ignored in case of this recurrent bleeding
2423,2423,ok then so well leave it like that for now ok im gonna leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions just for you to read about it i dont want you to panic but just for you to be aware what symptoms are,ok then well leave like that for ok leave a to information reactions for you it dont panic just to be what,ok then well leave it like that for ok and leave a guide to information and reactions for you and it dont panic just to be what it is
2424,2424,if those kind of things happen get back to us,if those kind things get back us,if those kind of things get back to us

2849,2849,ok,ok,ok
2850,2850,and whats your diet like,your like,your personality is like that
2851,2851,ok,ok,ok
2852,2852,all right um now um in terms of this headache uh obviously i havent been able to examine you or see you directly,all um now um terms of uh obviously been able or directly,all um now um terms of uh have obviously not been able or directly described
2853,2853,but um it sounds like it might be one of two things it could be an element of what we call tension headache,but um it it might two it could an of what call tension,but um it might be two it could be an expression of what we call tension
2854,2854,ok thats one possibility um and what makes that more likely is the fact that youve been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past ok um,possibility what makes more likely fact that under some and you a history of anxiety the past um,this makes it more likely than the fact that under some conditions and you have a history of anxiety in the past um
2855,2855,the other possibility is um migraine as well,the is um well,the patient is um well
2856,2856,ok um and the fact what makes that more likely is the fact that its on one side and that youve got some sensitivity to light,ok and what makes more likely the fact one side and that youve light,ok and what makes it more likely is the fact that one side is red and that youve light
2857,2857,ok so what what i think we can do is um i think we can give you some um generic pain relief,ok what what i think can do is i think we pain relief,what what i think we can do is improve pain relief
2858,2858,that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches ok so ill tell you what it is in a second,that be appropriate step for type so ill tell you it is in second,that may be the most appropriate step for this type of cancer so ill tell you it is in the second phase
2859,2859,sure ok and um uh did the did the pain wake you up,sure ok and did did pain wake you,sure ok and did did pain wake you
2860,2860,and the other thing that i was gonna suggest is we maybe look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work,and the other was suggest is we maybe explore things decrease stress from work,and the other was to suggest that is we maybe explore other things to decrease stress from work
2861,2861,so um the medication wise the things that wed start off first line if someone had migraine was to would be to start ibuprofen,so um wise the that off first if someone had would be to ibuprofen,so um wise the protocol that was taken off first if someone had bleeding would be changed to ibuprofen
2862,2862,and um uh that the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses ibuprofen so thats one thing we can start you can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like but the the ibuprofens um actually more effective for migraine,um uh be a more ibuprofen thats one thing we start you keep on paracetamol as well if you but the the ibuprofens more effective for migraine,um uh might be a more effective ibuprofen but thats one thing we start to recommend you keep on paracetamol as well if you have migraines but the study suggests that the treatment of ibacrofens is a better and less effective treatment for migraine
2863,2863,and um yeah so the the guidelines have changed recently we used we before that we used to give paracetamol as first line but now its um ibuprofen or aspirin,and yeah so the have changed we used we give paracetamol as first line but now its um ibuprofen aspirin,however the formulations have changed we used to give paracetamol as first line aspirin but now its um and ibuprofen as aspirin
2864,2864,thats thing um the other thing id like you to do is maybe consider taking some time off work ok because if the headache is due to stress from work,thats thing um other thing id maybe taking some time work if headache to stress from work,thats one thing um and other thing id maybe taking some time off work if headache leads to stress from work
2865,2865,um maybe having a week off if you self certify that might help with things and id also like you to explore counselling options as well so theres a counselling service in your area that i can give you the link for for you to self refer,um having a week off if certify might help and id also like you to explore counselling options as a i give you link for for you to self refer,um having a week off might help and id would also like you to explore counselling options as a result of this i give you a link for counselling for you and to self refer
2866,2866,id like you to ok id like you to try that um what were gonna do is well have a follow up in a weeks time,like you ok you to try that um what were do in weeks time,um what were you going to do in three weeks time
2867,2867,as well as those two things other things id like you to do is to try and ensure that youre having a minimum of seven eight hours sleep at night every night and youre drinking a minimum of um one point five to two litres uh of water or fluids a day and thats not including coffee or tea,as those things other things id like you to is to ensure having a minimum seven eight at night every night youre a um point five litres uh water or fluids a day thats not coffee or,as for those things other things id would like you to do is to ensure having a minimum of seven or eight hours at night every night youre a um point five litres uh water or fluids a day thats not coffee or tea
2868,2868,all right because sometimes dehydration and you know uh fatigue can be causes of headaches as well um,right sometimes dehydration you know uh fatigue can be headaches well,uh fatigue can be accompanied by headaches as well
2869,2869,yeah so it that that that is um you know we need to rule those things out um lets lets try that,yeah it that that that is um you know we need to rule those things out um that,yeah it is important that we know that that is um and we need to rule those things out as um that are not um
2870,2870,what what time did it wake you up,what did it wake you up,what did it do to wake you up
2871,2871,ok um and lets have a follow up appointment if were finding that things are not getting better we might need to arrange some blood tests or um look at uh other possibilities but well try that in the first instance,ok um lets have a follow up appointment were that things are not we might need to blood tests um at uh other but try that,the reasons for the follow up appointment were that if things are not well we might need to perform blood tests um at uh and other hospitals but try to avoid that
2872,2872,um if anything changes in the meantime or you get worried or things get worse feel free have a lower threshold for ringing us back and we can book you an appointment and we can reassess the situation,um if anything changes the or get or get feel free a lower for ringing back and we book an appointment we the situation,um if anything changes with the time to get or get feel free to make a lower rate for ringing back and we book an appointment when we are aware of the situation
2873,2873,ok no problem so therell be a summary of all of this in the notes um and ill also leave a link to some of the danger signs of symptoms of headaches in the notes if you can read through that in your own time that will just help you to have a bit more control over whats going on and understanding of what what what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor,ok problem so be a of in also leave a link to danger signs of symptoms of headaches the notes if can in your time that help you to have bit more control whats on and understanding what what kind of things should trigger you contacting another,in this problem so be aware of the fact that in addition to leave a link to danger signs of symptoms of headaches and the notes if you can find in your time that help you to have a bit more control of whats going on and understanding what what kind of things should trigger you contacting another person

3056,3056,like um the other common thing around thailand it will be like some dengue but that would have like you would have some uh blood spots or bleeding or something which you dont have at the moment do you,like um other common around thailand it will some dengue that have you would some blood spots or something which you dont have at do,like um and other common infections around thailand it will be some dengue that have been reported that you would have some blood spots or something which you dont have at present do not exist

3066,3066,but and then its the uh in meningitis you get a non blanching rash while in any kind of virus the rash usually goes away saying that we dont know whether these are the beginning stage so thats why id rather but i would rather you see a gp as soon as possible if uh weve got a slot available but if not i think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations ok,but and then its in meningitis you get a blanching rash in any of rash goes saying dont know whether these are beginning thats rather would you a as soon as if weve available if not think you seen and have blood examinations,but then when its in meningitis you get a blanching rash in any part of the rash the doctor goes on to say that he dont know whether these are the beginning or the end of them and that rather would you have a history as soon as possible if weve available and if not think you should be seen and have blood examinations

3150,3150,sorry you had thyroid problems,sorry you had thyroid problems,sorry you had thyroid problems
3151,3151,ohh yeah underactive thyroid yes yep,ohh yeah underactive yep,ohh yeah underactive yep
3152,3152,yeah youre taking thyroxine are you using it every day,are every day,are we doing this every day
3153,3153,why is that,that,that was not the case
3154,3154,ok so is that so all these things are since youve stopped taking the thyroxine,ok so so since taking the,ok so so since taking the medication
3155,3155,and uh and um whats your email address,and uh and whats your,and uh and whats your problem
3156,3156,when was your last blood test,was your last blood test,was your last blood test negative
3157,3157,ok so youve not had a blood test,so not had a blood,so far she had not had a blood transfusion
3158,3158,right ok it could you know generally for you know for underactive thyroids what symptoms youve said um its the opposite that usually happens yeah its for overactive thyroid like you can feel a bit like the racing of your heart beat and all so im not quite clear on what picture we are having here yeah,ok you know you know what symptoms youve said opposite that happens yeah its for overactive thyroid like can feel bit racing of beat and all im quite clear picture having here,if you know what symptoms youve said and the opposite that happens yeah its for overactive thyroid like can feel a bit like racing of beat and all in all im quite clear picture of having here
3159,3159,i think a general set of bloods is a good good start so what we look at because youre not youre not having the umph arent you youre like youre just feeling a bit you know low and things like that right well um and weak and things like that so well just do a general set of bloods we look at things like anaemia how your kidney functions are your livers all that with vitamin levels and your,i think general of bloods is a good start what we at not youre the umph arent youre like just feeling bit you know low and like that right well um and and things so well a general set bloods look things like anaemia how your functions are your livers all vitamin levels and,a good start to what we are looking at is not youre the umph arent theyre like just feeling a little bit you know low and like that right as well as um and y and things so well a general set of bloods look at things like anaemia how your functions are your livers all vitamin levels and so on
3160,3160,ok and uh now after we get those set of bloods we will find out if we can find anything in them if thats all clear then we would need to do a physical examination ok,ok and uh we get those will find out if we can find anything in if thats then we would need to a ok,we will get those results and will find out if we can find anything in them and if thats not then we would need to find a ok

3692,3692,ok so right so after you know speaking and examining you know yourself i think its quite important that we do investigate it a bit further im just wondering whether theres something a bit more than just the boxing here,ok so so after speaking examining think quite important that do a bit im whether theres something a than just the boxing here,after speaking with the experts and examining their experience we think quite important that we do a bit of im questioning whether theres something more than just the boxing here
3693,3693,ok few things thats made me think other than just like a boxing injury is for instance um you know when you said you cant your vision went your peripheral vision was not there for about twenty so and that with the weakness of the arms make me think is there something else going on rather than just an injury,ok few thats made me think just a boxing is um when said you vision peripheral was not for twenty weakness the make me think is there something else on just injury,just a boxing match is um when you said you vision peripheral injury was not responsible for twenty degrees of weakness in the pelvis make me think is there something else on just this injury
3694,3694,sometimes you know you do get things like ms multiple sclerosis so people with multiple sclerosis can have um visual problems like what youve experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on ok,know you do get things like multiple sclerosis with multiple can have um visual like what and you odd going ok,knowing that you do get things like multiple sclerosis with multiple organ failure you can have um visual problems like what is it and you have odd symptoms like going ok
3695,3695,we if we capture it a bit early there are treatments for it ok im not obviously im not suggesting that you do have it but it is quite important to find out that whether you have it or not thats the most serious kind of thing that needs to be uh dealt with here,if we a early there are treatments it ok im not obviously im not suggesting that you have it it is quite important to whether not the most serious kind thing needs uh dealt with here,if we have a very early indication that there are treatments for it ok im not obviously not suggesting that you have it it is quite important to know whether or not the most serious kind of thing needs uh dealt with here

3813,3813,ok um thats fine any other medication that youre using,um thats other medication that using,um is the only other medication that is currently approved for use in the united states
3814,3814,over the counter anything at all,over anything all,over all
3815,3815,ok right any allergies,ok right,ok right
3816,3816,no allergies at all righty fine so obviously you know you just have diarrhea its about four to five times a day um youre still drinking plenty and you look like youre not dehydrated which is a good sign ok um when we start worrying about diarrhea is if youre going more than eight times a day,no allergies at righty so obviously know have diarrhea its about to five times um still drinking plenty you look not is a good ok um when we start diarrhea is more eight times,we obviously know that when we have diarrhea its about four to five times um while still drinking plenty of water when you look not sick is a good ok um when the time we start diarrhea is more than eight times
3817,3817,that means probably you are you know whatever youre eating is going straight through ok you still need to drink plenty of water because youre losing a lot of fluids,means probably are whatever youre is going ok you still need to plenty of because youre a lot of,means probably are that whatever youre doing is going ok you still need to do plenty of work because there are a lot of problems
3818,3818,ok when you go to the toilet um things that one would advise is a soft diet so avoid dairy fish meat eggs while youre having the diarrhea go sorry,ok when you go to the toilet that one advise soft diet so avoid dairy meat while youre the diarrhea go,one should advise a soft diet so that you avoid dairy products and meat while youre on the toilet and diarrhea go away
3819,3819,ok so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of things thats easily digested like what we are good give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple food for babies you dont give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding so thats the kind of soft diet were talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of it in you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash,be like crackers kind digested like we are babies when they eating simple food babies give eggs or meat feeding so the of soft talking are able most of it in you can off with some just boiled mash,we are babies when they are eating simple food babies give eggs or meat feeding so the kind of soft talking babies are able to eat most of it in one day and you can feed them off with some just boiled mash
3820,3820,once youre ok with that for about forty eight hours then you can start having meat so just dont have meat once you feel like youre slightly better because you might go back to square one again all right,youre ok with for about forty eight hours can start having so have meat once you slightly because you go to one again all,for about forty eight hours you can start having meat so that you have meat once you are slightly satisfied because you go to one meal again after all
3821,3821,forty eight hours youre not having any diarrhea youre fine then you can go and start having meat egg fish and all so that,forty hours youre not having any diarrhea youre fine can start having fish and all so that,forty hours after not having any diarrhea youre fine and can start having fish oil and all so that is good
3822,3822,ok uh youve mentioned on our notes that youre suffering from bad diarrhea im sorry to hear about it so if you tell me a bit more about it please,youve mentioned on our notes that youre suffering from sorry to hear it so if you me a it, youve mentioned on our notes that youre suffering from hypertension and we were sorry to hear it so if you want me to have a discussion about it
3823,3823,no no no preferably just dont because what why do we say this its because it takes much more time for meat to get digested so because your gut flora you know the the the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food,no no preferably dont what do we say this because it takes time for get because your flora you the the gut you as should be takes for one to,no no preferably dont what do we say this because it takes time for the bacteria to get absorbed because your gut flora is not absorbed by you and the environment of the gut is you as it should be and it usually takes for one to two years
3824,3824,while it doesnt take that much of an effort to you know digest mash and vegetables does that make sense,while it much an to digest mash and vegetables that make sense,while it is much easier to digest mash and vegetables that make sense
3825,3825,yeah so um at the same time you could have some although you cant milk is not a good idea yoghurts are a good idea because they are probiotics it help to build up the normal um gut gut bacteria back,yeah um time you could have some milk not good idea are a good idea because probiotics it help up the normal gut bacteria back,yeah um at this time you could have some probiotics but not a good idea but they are a very good general idea because they can induce the gut microbiome and it can help up the normal gut bacteria back in balance
3826,3826,ok,ok,ok
3827,3827,so those kinda now things to look out for if your diarrhoea doesnt go away in a weeks time or if youre passing blood we need a stool sample because that means you you may have um some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics,so those kinda things to for if your diarrhoea doesnt in a weeks time or if youre blood we because um that,those kinda things to consider for if your diarrhoea doesnt resolve in a weeks time or if youre still receiving blood transfusions we did it because um that
3828,3828,ok if youre again as ive mentioned previously if youre going about six to eight times a day that means theres a high chance that uh you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time if that happens you get in touch with us again all right,ok if youre again as previously if to times day that means high chance that having dehydration and you need into that point time happens in touch us,as previously stated if youre unable to drink three times a day that means a high chance that you are having dehydration and you need to get into bed at that point before any time happens in touch with us

4188,4188,ok,ok,ok
4189,4189,and since your c section did you have to take any medications,your section did you have to take medications,your section did you have to take medications

4198,4198,have you measured it recently either with an iwatch or something similar,have measured either or,patientshave been measured by either or both methods

4200,4200,so uh what i need you to do is when i count to three count down from three just count the number of beats youve noticed and ill tell you when to stop is that ok,i is when i count to down three just number of youve tell you to is,i think that when i count down to three just the number of youve told you to do it is important
4201,4201,so well start in three two one go,start in three,start in three patients
4202,4202,great that should be enough how many did you count,great that should be enough you count,greater than that should be enough to make you count
4203,4203,good,good,good results
4204,4204,so your heart is running slightly fast at the moment which is probably because of the shortness of breath and some of the pain that youre under,so your heart is running slightly fast the moment which probably of shortness of pain youre,so your heart is running slightly fast at the moment which probably explains the shortness of pain in youre
4205,4205,given that youve had a c section and youre short of breath which has come on quite recently and quite quickly,given had c and breath has come on quite recently and quite quickly,given that she had c and d breath has come on quite recently and quite quickly
4206,4206,it might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out the bit further,it might be you the hospital to get the bit further,it might be helpful for you to visit the hospital to get the bit further
4207,4207,so theres two ways of us doing this the first is i can call an ambulance or you can take yourself to the hospital with baby,of us doing this first is i can call an ambulance take yourself to the hospital baby,the first step is to call an ambulance and take yourself to the hospital with the baby
4208,4208,which one would you prefer,prefer,preferrals
4209,4209,sure and what i would suggest is go fairly quickly and take some bits for baby at the same time,and what i would is fairly quickly and take for baby at the time,and what i would recommend is to quickly and effectively take care of the baby at the time of delivery
4210,4210,and if youre taking any medications like codeine dont dont take them for the time being,youre taking any like take for being,theyre not taking any medications like take for being overweight

4213,4213,nineteen eighty three and are you in a space thats private and quiet and you can talk,three space thats private and quiet you talk,three spaces thats private and quiet you talk
4214,4214,so i think thats the best thing to do for the time being,so i think thats the to for the time being,so i think thats the only solution to the problem for the time being
4215,4215,so what im worried about at the moment is given that youve had a c section,so what im worried about that youve had c section,so what im worried about is that youve had a c section

4217,4217,its quite a common thing to happen and its not something to worry about but needs to be checked out in the hospital first,quite a common thing to happen and its about but to checked out in the hospital,its quite a common thing to happen and its about as common as it is to be checked out in the hospital
4218,4218,and if it if that does become the case they can give you something to reduce the clot,and it if become case they can give you to,and if it does become a case they can give you a referral to a hospital

4416,4416,yeah,yeah,yeah
4417,4417,ok,ok,ok
4418,4418,ok,ok,ok
4419,4419,ok,ok,ok
4420,4420,ok its very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this normally its when you eat um bad food or food that has gone off and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested but just to double check have you noticed any problems with your breathing,ok its very unlikely inhaler cause tummy pain normally when you um bad or food and you normally symptoms you have suggested just to double check have you noticed any,ok its very unlikely that inhaler can cause tummy pain normally when you are um bad or food allergic and you normally have symptoms you have suggested just to double check have you noticed any symptoms
4421,4421,ok,ok,ok
4422,4422,ok and how about chest have you noticed any chest pain,ok and chest have you noticed chest pain,ok and chest pain have you noticed chest pains
4423,4423,ok and how about um walking and talking are those all both ok,ok and walking and are those both,ok and walking distance are similar in those of both groups
4424,4424,yep and when you press on your tummy does it cause any pain,when on your it cause any pain,when on your own it did not cause any pain
4425,4425,ok,ok,ok
4426,4426,sorry i was just writing some things down,i was just some things,i was just confused about some things
4427,4427,so what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and its causing your tummy pain and its this is normally called gastroenteritis so an infection of the tummy,so what like to that might have eaten bad and causing tummy and its this is normally gastroenteritis so an infection of tummy,so what would it like to know that a patient might have eaten bad food and been infected causing tummy rupture and its possible that this is normally associated with gastroenteritis so an infection of the stomach is rare
4428,4428,normally when patients have this do some things number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because youre losing lots at the moment number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers so if you start getting a temperature then you need,patients have this things number one is drink of losing lots the moment number two is make sure and look out for any fevers if getting temperature,among these things number one is to drink a lot of water losing lots of blood at the moment and number two is make sure and look out for any fevers if you are getting temperature
4429,4429,and please stay home for the time being until you get slightly better,and stay home the time being you get better,for the time being you get better
4430,4430,ok and are you in a space thats quiet and youre able to talk,you thats able to talk,however i dont know if thats able to talk
4431,4431,and normally,and normally,he was walking normally
4432,4432,normally things like antibiotics dont help they make the situation worse,like antibiotics dont they the situation worse,like antibiotics dont they make the situation worse
4433,4433,so thats,thats,thats not mandatory
4434,4434,go ahead,go,go
4435,4435,so i think thats what we should do for the time being if you feel youre getting much worse than i would suggest you go and see your gp in real in real life in person so they can loot at your belly,so i thats what do for you much worse i suggest you and see gp in real so they can loot at your,since i dont know what will do for you much worse i suggest you go and see gp in real life so they can loot at your expense
4436,4436,great cool do you have any more questions for me,cool do more questions,cooler people do more questions
4437,4437,yes,yes,yes
4438,4438,so the the things that youve told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had but if your things dont get worse then thats something that we can look up from the gp,so the the are most suggestive infection of your tummy and likely be something your father had if your things dont worse thats something that can look from the,so the lesions of the stomach are most suggestive of infection of your tummy and likely be something your father had and if your things dont get worse thats something that can look from the outside
4439,4439,does that sound ok,does,does it matter
4440,4440,thank you,thank you,thank you

6198,6198,um i think its important to get some blood tests checking all the normal things like liver kidneys blood count etc but also some more specific things like um a bacterial infection you can sometimes get uh including one which you can get which can produce a rash like that so that would involve blood tests are you happy to do that,think its to get some blood tests all things like liver kidneys count etc but some a infection sometimes uh including one which you can can produce that would involve blood you to do that,think its important to get some blood tests for all things like liver kidneys platelet count etc but some of them show a bacterial infection sometimes uh including one which you can or can not produce that would involve blood transfusion so you need to do that
6199,6199,well you can get uh you can get a bacterial infection caused which is called um its called lyme disease that you can get a rash like that from a tick bite,well can you get bacterial infection which is called um lyme that you a rash like a tick bite,well can you get bacterial infection which is called um lyme that causes you a rash like a tick bite
6200,6200,ok um so when do you think you were last well,so when do you you were last well,so when do you think you were last well
6201,6201,so thats something we would do a test for as well um and if that comes back positive then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it,so for as well um and if back then there are antibiotics treat it,so for as well as um and if back then there are antibiotics to treat it
6202,6202,so its definitely worth checking for but we would also check just for which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching for persistent over six weeks,so worth for but we also just for which can reduced energy tiredness and for over six,so it is worth investigating not only for fatigue but also for pain which can lead to reduced energy expenditure tiredness and fatigue for over six months
6203,6203,so if youre happy to do that if you book that through the support line and then when youve had the test arrange a follow up about a week after after youve had the test done,if to if that the support and then the test a follow up about after youve had the done,if to see if that is the support and then the test is a follow up about six months after youve had the procedure done
