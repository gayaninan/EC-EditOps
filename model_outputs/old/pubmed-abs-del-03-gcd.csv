112,112,yeah okay,yeah okay,yeah okay
113,113,and so do you have any sort of ideas what might be going on yourself or any concerns at this point,have any sort of ideas what might be going on yourself or concerns at this point,have any sort of idea what might be going on with yourself or your concerns at this point
114,114,yeah im a bit worried just because its been so well controlled for few years now im worried that my is my adalimumab stopped working or is something else causing my symptoms,yeah im a bit worried because its been so well for few years now worried is my stopped or is something causing my,yeah im a bit worried because its been so well for few years now and worried is my medication stopped or is there something causing my symptoms
115,115,or what do you think,or do think,or do you think so
116,116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,so a things that going to know different tests so one of them youre right be that the adalimumab of lost its sometimes happens and we test that for level of in your body and um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the as well,so a few things that we are going to know about different tests so one of them youre right should be that the adalimumab is of lost value its sometimes happens and we test that for level of antibodies in your body and um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well
117,117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,can ineffective we can easily check and the other thing is that because youve surgery in the past that can sometimes how bile salts reabsorbed and sometimes that cause diarrhoea if high of bile salts in your bowel but quite easy check for us,the other thing is that because youve undergone bariatric surgery in the past that can sometimes change how bile salts are reabsorbed and sometimes that cause diarrhoea if there is a high concentration of biliary salts in your bowel but quite easy to check for us
118,118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,of course you need to also about your disease flaring up as so the other thing to do is a faecal in youve probably done before,of course you need to also think about your disease flaring up as well so the other thing to do is a faecal examination in which youve probably done it before
119,119,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes,just a cheque for bowel so thats we might to look making some,thus we might be able to look into making some recommendations
120,120,do you have any questions about all of that quite a lot of information,do you have any questions about all of a of information,do you have any questions about all of this a lack of information
121,121,yeah its okay if you do need to change my medication like what would be the next step,yeah its need to change my like what would be the next step,yeah its a need to change my lifestyle like what would be the next step
122,122,so theres a few different options so there is a medication called and infliximab which is similar to adalimumab or we might look at you know switching you to a completely different drug um as well also also called the biologic different works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab but yeah i think first of all well get some up to date tests on first might need to get a ct scan or also an mri scan of your small bowel just to have a look and see if theres any inflammation in the bowel that might be you know causing your symptoms,so theres a few different options there is called and infliximab which similar to or might look know switching a completely different drug um as well also also called works in different way the bodies it is vedolizumab but yeah think first of all well up on first need a ct scan also an mri scan of your small bowel to have a look and if theres any inflammation the bowel be you know causing your symptoms,it is called vedolizumab and infliximab which is similar to or might look like but you know switching to a completely different drug um as well is also also called diclofenac which works in a different way in the different bodies and it is not as effective as ivyclofanac vidoliazumib but yeah think first of all you must well up on the first day need a ct scan also an mri scan of your small bowel to have a look and if theres any inflammation the bowel should be inspected so you can know what is causing your symptoms
123,123,and i had surgery before my treatment wasnt working do you think thats a possibility in the future,and i had my wasnt working you thats possibility in the,and i had suspected my technique wasnt working for you thats a possibility in the future
124,124,so i mean its always possible we have to always keep it at the back of our mind and hopefully they you know we can try and work out whats going on and that do something medically but yeah ofcourse we have to always think about surgery is as a possibility,so i its possible we have always keep it the of mind they you we can try and work whats going on and that do medically but yeah to always think about is as a possibility,so i think its possible that we have always kept it in the forefront of mind that if they present to you we can try and work out whats going on and that they do not present medically but yeah we need to always think about it as a possibility
125,125,yeah but hopefully not,but,but not all

160,160,no not really no ,really no,there was really no difference
161,161,so that we took some biopsies when we did the colonoscopy and it looks like you do have something called ulcerative colitis okay so they were in keeping with with that condition i dont know how much you know about inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis ,that we took some when we did the colonoscopy looks like you do have something called colitis okay so were in with condition i know much know about inflammatory bowel ulcerative colitis,when we did the colonoscopy it looks like you do have something called ulcerative colitis okay so if you were in a patient with this condition i know much to know about inflammatory bowel disease  and the potential cause of ulcersative colonitis

163,163,okay so its what we call a chronic condition so its something that youre going to have life long unfortunately um but its a condition that we can control very well with medications in the vast majority of people so to start with well start you on a course of steroids i dont think youve had any from your gp yet but that should help to sort of calm down the inflammation in your bowel and then well get you started on some other maintenance therapies im going into details of that on at the next consultation do you have any questions about that just at the moment ,so a chronic condition something that youre going to life unfortunately um but its that control very with medications in the majority people so to start with you on a of think youve had any from your gp that help sort of calm down the inflammation in your bowel get started some maintenance therapies im going into details of that on at next you have any questions that just at the moment,so a chronic condition is something that youre going to have to face in life unfortunately um but its a condition that can control very well with medications in the majority of people so to start with you on a level of control if youve had any suggestions from your gp that help sort of calm down the inflammation in your bowel and get started on some maintenance therapies im going into details of that on at next visit if any of you have any questions that are just burning at the moment
164,164,um so um yeah sorry its just lot to take in ,um so um yeah its lot to in,um so um yeah its a lot to deal with in general
165,165,so how long will be on these steroids for is that for lifelong ,long be on these steroids for is that for lifelong,long term followup should be performed on these steroids for that reason for lifelong remission
166,166,so the steroids are normally just for 8 to 68 weeks until the inflammation has has died down ,so the are just 8 to 68 weeks the inflammation has died down,so the results are just 8 to 68 weeks after the inflammation has died down
167,167,and hopefully your bowel have it should be going back to normal,hopefully your bowel it should going to normal,hopefully your bowel sounds are normal and it should be going to normal
168,168,and you should know its less blood as well if that doesnt happen with the steroids then we would want to know about that in case we need to do some further investigations but in terms of maintenance therapies that we talked about you will be on those for longer term and often people are on them lifelong or certainly for years depending on the course of their disease ,and should its less if doesnt happen with the steroids then would want to know about that in case we need do some further investigations in terms of maintenance therapies that talked about will be on those for term often people are on lifelong or certainly for years depending on the course of their disease,and should its less likely if it doesnt happen with the steroids then we would want to know about that in case we need to do some further investigations in terms of the maintenance therapies that are talked about and will be based on those for the long term often people are on lifelong or certainly for years depending on the course of their disease

208,208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,yeah theres a few different things it could be youve a colonoscopy quite some time fact not said to you shortly after were diagnosed so we might need look that think in the first will some blood inflammatory markers and we to send some samples of stool off to infection also send off a special stool test called fecal for inflammation in your that might to crohns disease i think depending what those are decide whether need camera up up the tail a look the of the so i what we are doing just that the how to you,yeah theres a few different things it could be youve had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact it was not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need a look that we think in the first place will reveal some blood inflammatory markers and we may need to send some samples of stool off to identify infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal biopsy for inflammation in your stool that might lead to crohns disease i think depending what those are we should decide whether we need the camera up up high up the tail and taking a closer look at the examination of the colon so
209,209,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in ,yeah mean yeah thats all right i didnt getting all these and things quite a lot to take,yeah mean yeah thats all right i didnt getting all these and other things quite a lot to take

213,213,yeah do you think i need to change my medication to something else ,yeah do you think i need to change my medication else,yeah do you think i need to change my medication or else
214,214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,the can do is the level of the medication in your blood called adalimumab the antibodies and the level of drug at moment i wouldnt from your until weve got a bit more information whats going,the only treatment that can do is the level of the medication in your blood called adalimumab the presence of immunoglobulin  the antibodies and the levels of drug at the moment i wouldnt differ from your medication until weve got a bit more information about whats going on
215,215,okay you think i might need more surgery ,okay you think i might need more surgery,okay you think i might need more surgery
216,216,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay ,well it little bit on investigations we might you know depending on they show we need to on and get mri scan of your bowel just have look and make sure there arent other of the you had last time thats the case then need to at surgery thats a further down the line a moment,well it depends little bit on investigations we might let you know depending on what they show we need to go on and get a mri scan of your bowel just have a look and make sure there arent other abnormalities of the bowel you had last time thats the case and then we may need them at surgery thats a further down the line for a moment
