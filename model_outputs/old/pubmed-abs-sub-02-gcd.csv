116,116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,yeah so there a few things that might be going on to know we only need few unlike tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can trial for that by doing a blood test to check for the flush of the drug in your soundbox and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,yeah so there a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the levels of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drugs as well
117,117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the early thing is that because youve consume operation in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts draw reabsorbed um and sometimes that can causal_agent diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions merely thats quite easy to check for us well,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had operations in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts draw reabsorbed um and sometimes that  can cause diarrhoea if you´ve got high levels of biliary salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well

208,208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnose so we might need to look astatine recur that i think in the first example will catch some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to gain certain theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for ignition in your intestine that might be related to the crohns disease i remember depending on what those cost well maybe decide on whether you motivation another television_camera test up up the tail end to have a expect at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at it further so that  i thought in the first example will catch some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we needed to send some samples of your stool off  to gain certain theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin  and thats to find for inflammation in your intestine that might be related to the crohns disease i remember depending
209,209,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in ,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and matter quite a draw to take in,yeah i mean yes yeah thats all right  yeah i just yeah  i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and matter quite a lot to take in

214,214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication inch your blood predict the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of  the medication in your blood predicting the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the levels ofthe drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalsimumabs just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on
