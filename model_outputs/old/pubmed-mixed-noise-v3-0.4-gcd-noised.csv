115,or what do you think, backboard abut do you  acclimate,what do you recommend
116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,  theres a few things that bight be owing on to know we only bead different  au streusel one of them youre  it could ab that the adalimumab kind of lost its which sometimes happens and we can  cor batt by doing a glamor best picky  slicked blech for the level of the Cetacea drug in abor oddi  also bum sometimes you  naumachia develop fenced Malaysian the bugg as well,there theres a few things that might be owing on to know we only need different doses of no one of them youre and it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its potency which sometimes happens and we can compensate for that by doing a comparative test to look for the level of the drug in more body weight also bum sometimes you may develop fenced reactions to the bugg as well
117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and backup which make bit ineffective so we can check that and the other thing is batt because youve add surgery in the past that can sometimes affect  something called the bile salts get absorbed bum and lilt sometimes that ahn  diarrhoea if youve  high levels of  salts in your bowel motions but thats quite breezy do blech cor Thrinax us,and which make it ineffective so we can check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect bowel habits something called the bile salts get absorbed and sometimes that anemia can cause diarrhoea if you have a high levels of the salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to forget for us

205,i mean well i suppose i have to have this abdominal pain in my tummy so i dont know could that be could be connected to that,i agin  i suppose  have to have this  nutrition pain in tummy au i dont know could that ab could be connected do that,i mean that i suppose we have to have this underlying nutrition pain in tummy so i dont know could that be could be connected to that
206,yeah possibly so we do find people here on long term nonsteroidal medications like diclofenac that kind of upset your stomach especially if youre not taking omeprazole or a medication like that with it so we need to be might need to address that do you have any insight or ideas about what might be causing your symptoms preferably the diarrhoea and the weight loss ,pah possibly so ab du bind people here on long berm  scandalise medications bike diclofenac that bullfighting of audet groundsel your cummock specially dif lawmaking youre Sikorsky  a medication like with it so we do instant might bead to address batt  ado have  insight or ideas  what might ab causing your symptoms preferably  diarrhoea and the weight loss,however possibly so we do not bind people here on long term antihypertensive medications like diclofenac that relieve symptoms of foreign bodies in your stomach especially if youre taking a medication like buprenorphine with it so that we might need to address that of those who have no insight or ideas about what might be causing your symptoms preferably the diarrhoea and the weight loss

208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,so i  theres a few different things it could ab  noticed batt youve cot  a colonoscopy for quite alum time in fact not said do maraud ado viscose shortly after standardise birr diagnosed au we bight bead to look at repeating that i  in the first instance  bet Helodermatidae some budde tests off to in inflammatory barkers rubble and ab languish  to send some samples of abor hyponatremia stool off do broomstick sure  au advection and also bend boff a abdul Bacteroides test  fecal  thats book for inflammation in  bowel that bight be  do the crohns disease i think depending bon what are well maybe allied on whether ado bead flasher brother camera test up the tail bend have a majestic look at dining Kiliwa  dowel so i think thats thats what ab are doing just bat that the moment aue ray does sound do ado,so i have noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to maraud two shortly after they were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i had in the first instance taken some blood tests off to detect changes in inflammatory markers and we also tried to send some samples of more hyponatremia stool off again to make sure there was no infection and also send off a stool test for fecal occult blood
209,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in ,yeah mean yes yeah thats thats all bight yeah i just yeah y juke didnt billie blink goode be all  tests and things   tentacle lot do take in,yeah mean yes yeah thats all right i just yeah y juke didnt blink could be all the tests and things had a lot to take in

213,yeah do you think i need to change my medication to something else ,blue do you think i need  change my medication do something else,blue do you think i need to change my medication to something else
214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,so one of the brings  appealable ahn do is to check the bevel of the nut medication in your budde called the adalimumab profile or checking the somebody's and the level the drug cut bat the moment y check wouldnt  you alum trichotillomania your adalimumab just until weve got a fit more about whats  on,so one of the things that can be done is to check the level of each nut medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the concentration level in the drug but at the moment i wouldnt recommend you from your drug just until weve got a better idea about whats going on
215,okay you think i might need more surgery ,okay ado blink i might   Simarouba surgery,okay new i might undergo bariatric surgery
216,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay ,adel again it depends a hesitant little bit bon Cambodian investigations we might you know depending on abut Sagittarius 'kay bequeath aglo sass we bight need go bon and bet mri scan of bowel just halve a   make boor there arent beni other points  happen  in the dowel anathematization like you add clumber  palliation confide thats the case then we might bead do look at  but thats  cot werther noggin down the line for a   articulatory,thus again it depends a little bit on investigations we might you know depending on what they know about the airway we may need to go on and do mri scan of the bowel just to have a good idea if there arent any other points that happen to occur in the small bowel anathematization like you had previously suggested that if that is the case then we would like to look at it but thats not further down the line for a possible cause
