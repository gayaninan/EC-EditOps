3818,3818,ok when you go to the toilet um things that one would advise is a soft diet so avoid dairy fish meat eggs while youre having the diarrhea go sorry,ok when go to the um things that one advise is diet so avoid dairy eggs while youre having diarrhea go sorry,ok when you go to the um things that one advise is diet so avoid dairy eggs while youre having diarrhea go sorry
3819,3819,ok so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of things thats easily digested like what we are good give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple food for babies you dont give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding so thats the kind of soft diet were talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of it in you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash,ok so that will be like crackers toast of things thats easily digested what we are good give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple for you dont eggs meat the first time they start so thats the kind of soft were talking about yeah once are able know most of in start off with some boiled vegetables and mash,ok so that will be like crackers toast of things thats easily digested what we are good to give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple eggs for you dont eat eggs or meat the first time they eat so thats the kind of soft foods we were talking about yeah once they are able to know most of the foods in their diet start off with some boiled vegetables and mash
3820,3820,once youre ok with that for about forty eight hours then you can start having meat so just dont have meat once you feel like youre slightly better because you might go back to square one again all right,once youre ok with for about forty eight hours start having meat so just dont meat once you feel youre slightly better because go back to square again all right,once youre ok with it for about forty eight hours you start having more meat so just dont eat meat once you feel like you’re slightly better because you go back to square again all right

3823,3823,no no no preferably just dont because what why do we say this its because it takes much more time for meat to get digested so because your gut flora you know the the the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food,no no no preferably dont because why we say this its because it takes much more time meat to so because your flora you the bacteria in your gut is not know as it should it a bit more effort for one to digest these food,why we say this its because it takes much more time for meat to digest so because your flora differs from you the bacteria in your gut is not know as it should make it a bit more effort for one to orally digest these food
3824,3824,while it doesnt take that much of an effort to you know digest mash and vegetables does that make sense,while doesnt take that much of an effort to know digest mash vegetables does that make,while it doesnt take that much of an effort to know how to digest mash vegetables does that make sense
