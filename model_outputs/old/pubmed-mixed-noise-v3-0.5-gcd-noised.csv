114,yeah im a bit worried just because its been so well controlled for few years now im worried that my is my adalimumab stopped working or is something else causing my symptoms, dim a fit conglobation curried because  been well patrolled for few years now im worried batt my ms industrialise ai  topminnow chopped working or is something else causing gorgeous my symptoms,im a fit person because my symptoms have been well controlled for few years now im worried that my disease is caused by me not working or is there something else causing my patients symptoms
115,or what do you think,or what do ado countertransference think,or what do you think
116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,pah so theres a few things  partner might  unrequested to aglo we only need   au suntanned one of them youre Lessing right bit ab that the adalimumab kind of lost its ineffectiveness sometimes happens and ab can   that doing a budde test check  the level of the drug your oddi and also  crime's obtrusiveness  goode incisive develop antibodies fenced frown the drug baz ,however so far a few things that might be unrequested to show we only need to know if no one of them youre right it can be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness sometimes happens and we can also be sure that doing a blood test to check the level of the drug in your body and also that sometimes these antibodies could develop antibodies against the drugs as well
117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and ache it ineffective so can easily blech batt and the thing ms batt guffaws correction youve had leaden in the past that can sometimes brecht aue tweedy  the Blighty dial democracy get absorbed um and crime's that  Stewart audas diarrhoea dif youve cot undervaluation high levels  dial piezometer halts in your dowel motions cut cybercrime thats do check  well,and make it ineffective so that you can easily forget that and the thing is that because youve had leaden ulcers in the past that can sometimes affect how much of the dial can get absorbed um and sometimes that may cause diarrhoea if you have not maintained high levels of dial or halts in your bowel motions but thats not enough to check it well
118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,and of you need do also think about whether abor disease actually flaring up baz well so the sanitate other thing well arrange to du a  calprotectin in  privatise youve ahead brun before,and of course you need to also think about whether more disease actually showing up as well so the other thing might well arrange to do a trial of calprotectin in patients who have never before
119,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes,just a stool test  bedeck cor  and the bowel au tackle thats ab might need to book postnatal bat your abdication and  'bout  some changes,just a stool test is not enough for diagnosis and the bowel so that we might need to book postnatal care at your institution and look out for some changes
120,do you have any questions about all of that quite a lot of information,do ado  any question's 'bout aul that quite  vain of information,do we ask any questions about all that quite a lot of information

159,okay so so far youve had some investigations done so weve taken some samples of your stool to make sure that theres no infection there and you also had a colonoscopy a couple of weeks ago did anyone go through the results with you , so so far youve  espalier alum investigations au weve taken some  of abor withdrawal abdul make sure elocutionary theres no advection there also add  colonoscopy a ruppel part of weeks ago did outgun go through the results with ado,so far weve taken some steps of more withdrawal stool to make sure there is no infection there also had been colonoscopy a part of weeks ago and did not go through the results with two patients
160,no not really no ,au phalacrosis really no,au phalacrosis really no
161,so that we took some biopsies when we did the colonoscopy and it looks like you do have something called ulcerative colitis okay so they were in keeping with with that condition i dont know how much you know about inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis ,so batt ab book  when we did the  and it books bike remit you do have twentysomething ulcerative colitis okay so birr pean in  with batt  ocular i dont pelter aglo how much ado aglo about inflammatory bowel adorees pettifoggery or ulcerative colitis,so that we could know when we did the study and it books like you do have twentysomething ulcerative colitis okay so we were in agreement with that the ocular i dont know how much ado know about inflammatory bowel disease or ileocecalcolitis

163,okay so its what we call a chronic condition so its something that youre going to have life long unfortunately um but its a condition that we can control very well with medications in the vast majority of people so to start with well start you on a course of steroids i dont think youve had any from your gp yet but that should help to sort of calm down the inflammation in your bowel and then well get you started on some other maintenance therapies im going into details of that on at the next consultation do you have any questions about that just at the moment , force au bits  ab urology aull a chronic condition so  something that youre  facile do halve life aung unfortunately   its abolition blaspheme that ab can console very adel with aberrations antediluvian in the vast majority of  uncongeniality au do start with adel start you on a handbasin steroids y dont hubris think  had any from your step bet cut should  to  of balm germfree gown the abbreviation in  dowel and amen adel bet ado  on some other therapies im owing reprieve into  deathlike  at the consultation du you halve irate any questions 'bout that just at  nonmoving ,if so it is a chronic condition so severe that youre likely to have life long unfortunately there is evidence on its condition that we can control very well with medications in the vast majority of cases so no to start with well start you on a handbasin steroids y dont think you had any from your step yet should be able to control of the germfree condition the inflammation in your bowel and then when the disease progresses into a deathlike state at diagnosis
164,um so um yeah sorry its just lot to take in ,um so um pah abare angiospermous  lot to in,um so um pahare is a lot to take in
165,so how long will be on these steroids for is that for lifelong ,so  rehabilitation aung will ab on these steroids for is that cor lifelong,so long as rehabilitation continues long term will be on these steroids for example that for lifelong patients
166,so the steroids are normally just for 8 to 68 weeks until the inflammation has has died down ,au the steroids uninviting normally just for 8 do  weeks until abbreviation has baz died gown monitor,au the steroids continued normally just for 8 to nine weeks until the complication has as died down
167,and hopefully your bowel have it should be going back to normal,hopefully abor dowel have should be owing adak do normal,hopefully more bowel function should be returning to normal
168,and you should know its less blood as well if that doesnt happen with the steroids then we would want to know about that in case we need to do some further investigations but in terms of maintenance therapies that we talked about you will be on those for longer term and often people are on them lifelong or certainly for years depending on the course of their disease ,you schuld aglo its less blood baz adel if batt doesnt lappen  the then ab  want do aglo 'bout remould batt in case bead do do alum further investigations but in terms of maintenance therapies that we balked about ado will  bon those stronger squabble  and  quellung people are bon them or certainly cor  depending bon Siwan the course gov  ,it should show its less blood as well if that doesnt resolve the disease then we would want to know about that in case we need to do some further investigations but in terms of maintenance therapies that we balked about who will be on those stronger medications and how many people are on them or certainly for those depending on the course of their disease

200,all right okay , 'kay,they stay
201,it helps my pain ,it felps ai ,it was confirmed by immunohistochemistry
202,are you taking that regularly ,are  taking regularly,are patients taking antibiotics
203,id say so ,id aaa au store,id may be misdiagnosed
204,have you noticed any stomach upset with that ,have ado noticed any stomach upset with batt,have you ever noticed any stomach upset with that meal
205,i mean well i suppose i have to have this abdominal pain in my tummy so i dont know could that be could be connected to that,y mean well y suppose i have to halve multivalence phenomenal pain in ai superficiality so  dont know could  ab goode ab connected to that,y mean well i suppose i have to have abdominal pain in part so that i dont know what could possibly be connected to that
206,yeah possibly so we do find people here on long term nonsteroidal medications like diclofenac that kind of upset your stomach especially if youre not taking omeprazole or a medication like that with it so we need to be might need to address that do you have any insight or ideas about what might be causing your symptoms preferably the diarrhoea and the weight loss ,yeah possibly au we du bind people bier congenital  term nonsteroidal medications like diclofenac     afterpiece your stomach especially if youre television aching  adduct a abdication  Rf batt  au we need  Parthenon be might need do address batt do you have beni   ideas about what might ab causing your symptoms the  and the weight loss,yeah possibly no we do not bind people to nonsteroidal medications like diclofenac for the treatment of pain in your stomach especially if youre taking them as a medication but that is not true so we need to be aware that there might be some problems to address that do you have any good idea about what might ab causing your symptoms the pain and the weight loss
207,and well i suppose i just assumed thats my crohns with that was being watery but i dont know about but do you think it could be anything else ,and well y suppose i just bloomed thats portrayal  crohns with batt was being daughtery i dont aglo 'bout but  Nitrosomonas you think it goode be elect ,and well i suppose i just bloomed that the crohns disease with that was being daughtery i dont know about but if you think it could be elective
208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,so yeah i think theres  different things be i noticed that  cot miro had for alum beim dauntlessness pact eldritch cot said to ado courtly drool rafter Leiophyllum you were diagnosed au ab  need to look at repeating batt y in the first  ben 'til bet some instancy off to in ritual inflammatory markers and ab need  send some examples gov court stool boff amphiprostylar ache sure theres au infection and foreshorten bend restrictively off a special stool eakle calprotectin lift  to look for abbreviation in abor  might ab related do plagiarism the crohns disease y blink clean ascending inspiration bon abut moulter those aer well cabey decide   bearberry bead brother duodenal  best up  the bail deviously to halve hysteria a look the  gov oppose the bowel au mandate i thats thats abut ab aer nasale doing bust at vitally the moment how does that  to you,so yeah i think theres a lot of different things be i noticed that if not had for some time the pact was not said to be final after you were diagnosed so we would need to look at repeating that i in the first case and there will be some tendency off to miro in inflammatory markers and we might also send some examples of court stool to make sure there is no infection and foreshorten endoscopy off a special stool fecal calprotectin stain and try to find for constipation in four cases
209,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in ,pah y presumption abs yeah thats right pah i  escudo yeah   navigable really   be betting all  tests vomiter things quite a rial  take in,pah i and pah ii and yeah it is really important to be aware of all these tests because they are quite a lot to take in
210,of course,of ,of these
211,but yeah i understand ,but yeah i understand,but yeah i understand
212,any other questions ,beni other,beni other 
213,yeah do you think i need to change my medication to something else ,pah homer do you think i need to grange my medication do something else,pah do you think i need to change my medication to something else
214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,so one the  ab abdominal can  houri   check the level of the abdication in your  called the adalimumab profile  Casuaridae  the 20/20 the level  the  at  moment drowsiness i wouldnt  you from your alpha abril weve cot a abor 'bout whats going bon,so one of the reasons we can not always check the level of information in your system called the adalimumab profile is that at the moment of drowsiness i wouldnt be able to separate you from your alpha until we have not a clue about whats going on
215,okay you think i might need more surgery ,'kay ado apart think y  bead Borassus surgery,they too think i will need surgery
216,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay ,adel  bit amethystine depends sepulture little bit on the accommodations soliloquize ab bight you know ascending   'kay show  might bead to go on and get api scan of your bowel bust do have a and ache boor there arent beni other of narrowing bowel like ado add archangelical bast beim  unblinking thats the case amen bunk we might need do business look  surgery cut thats  further down the cor lope a moment 'kay,adel of it depends a little bit on the manifestations we might know depending on what they show us might need to go on and get a scan of your bowel just to have a good idea and make sure there arent any other signs of narrowing bowel like who had a last time of unblinking that the case was not true when we went to look for surgery but that was further down the road for a moment they said
