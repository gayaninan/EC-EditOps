144,144,um and uh having looked at your skin uh the the the rash does appear quite familiar um you mentioned using steroid creams yesterday,um and uh having at skin uh the the um you mentioned steroid yesterday,um and uh having atopic skin disease uh and the um and um you mentioned steroid therapy yesterday
145,145,um from the pharmacy i wonder whether giving you a stronger prescription of a of a steroid may be beneficial,the i a prescription of a may be beneficial,the use of i a prescription of a probiotic may be beneficial
146,146,uh which im happy to prescribe to you today as well as im going to give you something some emollients which helps to moisturize the skin,which happy to prescribe you as as im going to give something some the skin,as im going to give something to some of the skin lesions
147,147,um which use in the bath and shower and its definitely worth um using that for the first seven to ten days,um which the bath shower um for the to ten days,um which included the bath water and the um for the first six to ten days
148,148,uh before we make the decision on whether its working or not,uh we decision on whether or not,uh we made a decision on whether or not to continue
149,149,um its also worth um using antihistamines which you can sometimes buy over counter,um its also worth using buy over counter,um its also worth using as a buy over counter method
150,150,things like loratadine or piriton which can help the itchiness of your skin,loratadine or which can help of skin,loratadine or nifedipine which can help in the treatment of skin cancer
151,151,and uh um its also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap,and its also worth a of any triggers are or in terms of gels or,it is also worth a careful evaluation of whether any triggers are present or present in terms of gels or food intake
152,152,because if thats causing your symptoms then we need to have a discussion about an eczema cu,because thats your have discussion an eczema cu,because thats what your topic we have a discussion about an eczema cu

156,156,ok so its something for you to think about you can get different types of antihistamines i can give you something a little bit stronger today as well,ok something for you to think about types of antihistamines i give you a as well,ok if there is something for you to think about types of antihistamines i will give you a list as well
157,157,um something like fexofenadine which i can give to you today its definitely worth trying and its not going to do you any harm,um something fexofenadine which give today its definitely worth and its not to do any harm,um if there is something to be done with fexofenadine which will give you relief today its definitely worth taking and its not likely to do any harm

509,509,uh weve weve covered the majority of them already uh but i just want to make sure im not missing anything else,uh weve covered majority them i just want to sure im anything else,uh weve covered the majority of them i just want to make sure im not missing anything else
510,510,um hows your hows your chest hows your breathing um any,um hows your your hows your breathing any,um hows your bowel sounds your wls and your breathing are not any different
511,511,ok any uh funny heartbeats or rhythms palpitations,uh funny rhythms,uh funny rhythms

513,513,no ok alright um,um,um
514,514,ok did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual,ok did come suddenly was it gradual,ok did not come suddenly nor was it gradual
515,515,fine ok um so really just uh moving on um,fine ok so uh,fine ok so uh
516,516,and so based based on your story really uh uh kim its its its difficult its its um you know youve got some tummy pain you dont exactly know whats causing it it could be a few different things that could be causing your pain,so based based on your story really uh uh difficult its its um you know youve got pain dont whats causing it it different things that be causing pain,unfortunately it really uh difficult to describe its cause because its um you know youve got pain but dont know whats causing it and it is different things that could be causing pain
517,517,could just be a you know could just be a urine infection for example could just be something related to your gut um could just be something related to your you know a pregnancy related cause um and so its probably worth doing some tests initially,could a know could be be something to to pregnancy cause um its worth tests initially,could a know it could be something to add to pregnancy cause um and its worth taking tests initially
518,518,to try and rule out um whats going on here um which i can organize for you today,to and um whats going on here um which can organize,to learn and understand um whats going on here um which can help organize the world
519,519,um and basically those tests we well have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed but certainly it if its been going on for the last couple of days um,we have terms how should but if been going on of days,we have discussed in terms of how this should be done but if it has been going on for a number of days it should remain so
520,520,uh you know its probably maybe worth empirically treating you for a maybe urine infection and so its an,uh maybe worth you maybe urine and so its an,uh maybe it is worth you maybe urine and so its an important factor
521,521,yeah absolutely so um i think its certainly worth you know covering you with some antibiotics today,think its you with some antibiotics today,think its safe to treat you with some antibiotics today
522,522,uh but i still want you to bear in mind you know have a pregnancy test done to make sure were not missing anything else here,uh but i you to in you a test done to sure were not else here,uh but i would like to point out that in the present study a test was done to make sure that there were not any abnormalities anywhere else here
523,523,and um and i want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting any better or indeed if theyre getting worse,and um and you really back see me a few days time if your symptoms are better or indeed if theyre,and um and if you really want to come back see me in a few days time if your symptoms are better or indeed if theyre worse
524,524,so things to look out for would be you know worsening tummy pain um if youre feeling really hot or sweaty your temperatures not coming down um vomiting et cetera does that make sense,things to look out you know pain if hot or your temperatures coming down vomiting cetera does that make sense,do you know if your pain is hot or your temperatures are coming down vomiting and diarrhoea et cetera does that make sense
525,525,ok ok and can you describe the pain to me,ok and you describe the,ok and you describe the symptoms
526,526,ok um you can try just regular painkillers uh paracetamol would be advisable um make sure you drink plenty of fluids,ok um you try regular painkillers uh paracetamol would be um make of,unfortunately if you try regular painkillers uh paracetamol would be better um and make use of aspirin
527,527,you can try some cranberry juice as well which uh can sometimes help with your urine symptoms,you juice as well uh can urine,unfortunately you can drink juice as well as uh and can also drink urine
528,528,um take the antibiotics uh and give me a call you know if you are worried about anything else,um take uh and give me know if you are about,um take a uh test and give me know if you are serious about it
529,529,yeah if i send it straight to your pharmacy start the antibiotics today something called trimethoprim um you can take two tablets uh one tablet twice a day for three days,yeah it straight to pharmacy the antibiotics you can take tablets uh one tablet twice for three,yeah you can take two tablets uh one tablet twice for three weeks

647,647,which can sometimes happen um um and uh,which and uh,which is  and uh 
648,648,its so it seems like your hearts not pumping as well as it should be um and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure theres obviously,its so it like your pumping as it should um obviously heart obviously,its so that it sounds like your heart pumping as it should um obviously the heart is obviously pumping
649,649,um thats the first thing that comes to my mind um now theres a couple of options move forward um,the first thing that comes to um a move um,the first thing that comes to mind is um a move to um

1510,1510,right now um adriana do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms have you have you read anything online or spoken to people,right now do as could causing your symptoms you have you anything or spoken people,right now you do not know as to what could be causing your symptoms but you have not told you anything or spoken to people
1511,1511,mmm,mmm,mmm
1512,1512,ok is it anything in particular you were hoping i could do for you today,it anything in you were hoping i could do for you,there was not anything in particular that you were hoping i could do for you
1513,1513,ok,ok,ok
1514,1514,three days ago ok and whereabout in your head is this pain,days ok in your head pain,days were ok in your head pain
1515,1515,how many tablets did you take of ibuprofen,how many did,how many patients did not respond
1516,1516,three a day ok all right um so uh adriana so um really what i think is going on here i uh unfortunately i do think this could be a headache very similar to a migraine,ok all right um so uh adriana really i uh unfortunately think this a very to a migraine,unfortunately so uh adriana really i uh unfortunately think this is a very rare condition leading to a migraine
1517,1517,um the reason i say that is because the history is very suggestive of it given your mum and your sister also migraines i think its something for us to think about,um the i say that is because the very suggestive and also migraines think its something us to think about,um the i say that is because the very suggestive symptoms and also the migraines we think its something for us to think about
1518,1518,um now im not saying its gonna keep happening but it may just be a one off but its certainly worth treating it today stronger analgesia or painkillers,um now im saying its happening may one off but its worth treating analgesia,um now im saying that its happening may be one off but its worth treating with analgesia
1519,1519,um now moving forward we have some options which we can discuss uh you tried the ibuprofen now my only worry is im not sure whether youre taking the correct dose you can take up to two tablets three times a day,um now moving we options which we ibuprofen worry is im sure whether youre taking the correct dose can take two tablets three times,um is now moving towards options which we call ibuprofen but the worry is im not sure whether youre taking the correct dose or if you can take two tablets three times
1520,1520,so so theres definitely room for improvement there or i can prescribe you something stronger like naproxen which is another anti inflammatory which can be helpful,definitely room there or i prescribe you something like naproxen is another inflammatory which,in the emergency room if there is a need for sedation or i prescribe you something like naproxen is another inflammatory agent which is safe and effective
1521,1521,um we can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine which might be helpful as well,um also in other like or codeine which might helpful as well,um is also useful in other treatment modalities like diclofenac or codeine which might be helpful as well
1522,1522,ok and i think its certainly worth looking into that so i can give you a prescription for that today um with regards to um the next few days it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out whats you know if theres any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse,ok and think its certainly worth looking into i can you a for today with regards to um the be keeping diary so can try whats know if theres could be causing your to worse,ok and think its certainly worth looking into if i can give you a hint for today with regards to um theres a need to be keeping a diary so that you can try and know whats is going on and to know if this or thattheres something that could be causing your symptoms to get worse
1523,1523,and and you know id like you to come back and see me in about uh a weeks time week to two weeks time,and id like come back and uh weeks time weeks time,uh weeks time  and id like come back and uh weeks  were the most frequent weeks in all time periods
1524,1524,if you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis but we can have that discussion next time,are type we can about you as prophylactic means medications stop from having these headaches regular we can discussion next,if this type of headache persists we can provide information about you as well as prophylactic means of medications to stop you from having these headaches on regular basis so that they can have a discussion next year
1525,1525,ok um and is the headache there all the time or does it come and go,um headache all it go,um headache was all it could go
1526,1526,ok in the meantime if your headaches arent getting any better or theyre getting worse um you know i want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner ok,ok meantime if any theyre getting worse um you know i want to me come back me sooner,in the meantime if any of them are getting worse um you know i want to see me come back to me sooner
1527,1527,so if youre having any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs or youre just not feeling very well just give me a call and come back and see me,so youre having problems vision or in your and legs or youre feeling very call and come back and see me,when youre having problems with vision or in your arms and legs or when you are feeling very tired call me and come back and see me

1637,1637,something think about just in terms of your blood pressure and diabetes maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can,something about just terms blood diabetes that can if you,there is something about just in terms of blood glucose and diabetes that can be overlooked if you are not aware of it
1638,1638,really ideally the the the right answer is to cut down completely but so in practice i know thats not realistic so maybe for the first few weeks why dont you cut down to two glasses a week and then one week thereafter,ideally the the is down but so i know thats so the few why dont cut down a week and one week thereafter,so i know that if thats so the first few days why dont cut down a week and one week thereafter
1639,1639,um and if you are coping ok then you can maybe try and cut down altogether,um and if you can and altogether,um and if you can tolerate it and avoid it altogether
1640,1640,ok just something for you to think about um right so uh just as we wrap up really um april i think based on your story i think uh essentially i think youre youre going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness um i dont think theres anything to worry about,ok think uh just we wrap up really um april think based story i uh essentially i through a bit of um i dont think to,ok think uh just as we wrap up really um april i think based on this story i uh essentially think that i went through a bit of um i dont think to

1642,1642,im hoping that you know youre probably over the worst of it now its been five days im hoping youre maybe going to get better in the next couple of days it normally lasts for about a week to ten days,hoping that you know youre probably the worst of it its days hoping youre to the next it normally lasts about week,although youre probably the worst of it its one of the most painful days and hoping for the best to get to the next day it normally lasts about a week

1835,1835,k im just exclude the simple things simple things might be wax you know someone might have impacted wax blocking the tube going into the eardrum which can,things simple might be you know might have impacted the going into eardrum,things simple might be what you know that might have impacted the process of going into the eardrum
1836,1836,lead to muffled hearing um if thats the case that thats something thats easy fixable but um so we need to exclude that first,um if thats thats fixable so need,um if thats not fixable so we need to consider it
1837,1837,can you hear me ok,can you hear me,can you hear me
1838,1838,and then after that we can consider other potential possibilities um and for that we need to have a look inside the ear drum,and that we consider other potential um and for to a inside the drum,we suggest that we consider other potential um pitfalls and look for ways to prevent a leak inside the drum

1911,1911,ok so um what i think we should do with regards to your elbow problem,ok so um what we with to your problem,ok so um what do we do with your problem
1912,1912,ok is um i think it would be worthwhile this seems like uh what we call the bursitis ok so thats an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint,is i think it would worthwhile seems like uh what we so of the the joint,it seems like uh what we are doing so far is taking care of the joint
1913,1913,um what i think we should do is i think you should be on some anti inflammatory medication in the in the first instance,what think we should think you be inflammatory medication the instance,what do we think we should think of you when administering inflammatory medication in the first instance
1914,1914,and as well as that what i would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of uh causes of joint swelling k,as that what is get blood other causes of joint swelling k,as such we suggest that what is the best way to get blood from other causes of joint swelling in k
1915,1915,so um what were going to do is were going to arrange some um blood test forms to be sent out to your house and therell be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done,um what going to arrange some um test forms to sent to your and within that about to go to get tests done,um what are you going to arrange some um test forms to be sent to your physician and within a week that you are about to go to get tests done
1916,1916,and that will involve you um having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers infection rheumatological antibodies,will involve you um having check for inflammatory rheumatological antibodies,this will involve you um having a check for inflammatory and rheumatological antibodies
1917,1917,so well do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well ok um,so well a full check as ok,so as to justify a full history and physical examination as ok
1918,1918,the time frame for that will be um the results will come back to us after about five or six days um,time that um the results will back to us five or um,time will come that um the results will be back to us five or six months after um
1919,1919,from now but it may take time for the form to come out to you and if you get the form get the blood tests done straight away by the time that were expecting result back you know one or two days after that were looking maybe six days,from now but it take time for form to out to you form get the blood tests done away expecting result or that were looking maybe,it can take time for the form to be sent out to you and form from you to get the blood tests done away with expecting a negative result or that were looking maybe normal
1920,1920,ok ok great ok so um tell me a bit about whats been happening you said you mentioned in the notes that youve got a problem with your elbow,ok ok great ok me you said mentioned the notes that problem,ok ok great ok ok me you said the notes that solved the problem
1921,1921,and what i would suggest is we can arrange a follow up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint feel it we can review the blood test,and what would we can follow in where we your joint it can review blood,in cases where we cannot reach your joint it can be difficult to review blood samples
1922,1922,uh we can um get a gauge as to uh whats going on now in terms of your joint right now,we can um get a gauge going on now in of your joint,we can um get a pulse gauge going on now in the area of your joint
1923,1923,it doesnt look like to me thats something called excuse me septic arthritis so were worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint,it doesnt look like to arthritis so were worried that someone might have an acutely,they didnt look like they had arthritis so we were worried that someone might have an acutely inflammatory response
1924,1924,um and uh your your joint doesnt look like that,um and uh your joint doesnt look,um and uh your joint doesnt look good
1925,1925,however if your the elbow was to become very red very painful uh and the redness was to spread or become uh you know more intense then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible,the elbow to very red very uh the redness to or more then need to get video with us as possible,if the elbow appears to be very red or very uh the redness continues to worsen one or more times then we need to get the video with us as soon as possible
1926,1926,cause that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment more immediate treatment ok,that be an would require more assessment more immediate treatment ok,that would be an option that would require more assessment more immediate treatment and better ok

2112,2112,ok um the first thing id like to do is to try and measure your pulse,um the first id is to your pulse,um the first id is used to measure your pulse
2113,2113,so what the way were gonna do this is that if youre if i can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist,what gonna do this if if get try locate the,what is gonna do this if if you get lost try to locate the source
2114,2114,not everyone can do this so dont worry if you cant,not everyone can do so dont worry,not everyone can do it so dont worry
2115,2115,but if you if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse its just under the thumb if you put two fingers up and down like that you might be able to feel the pulse,if can whether you feel pulse its just if two up and down like that might able,if you can determine whether you feel a pulse its just as if two times up and down like that might be able
2116,2116,you got it ok are you sure,you are you,therefore you are you

2279,2279,ok so so what im gonna do is im uh im gonna refer you to a a mini stroke clinic or a tia clinic,so what im is im uh gonna or clinic,what im doing im uh gonna go to the hospital or clinic
2280,2280,how can i help you today,can i you today,can i share this with you today
2281,2281,um i send that referral off now and then you can attend them they theyll usually call you in within the next one to two days ok,um i referral off now and you usually you in within the one to ok,um i referral is off now and usually you are in within the one to two weeks of ok
2282,2282,because its something relatively urgent now today its wednesday so weve got a few days before the weekend so um uh basically the deadline should be thursday friday,its relatively urgent so a few days weekend um basically the deadline be friday,a few days after the weekend um basically the deadline will be friday
2283,2283,were expecting you to be seen by the time thats the kind of turnaround were were looking at,were expecting the time kind were at,were expecting the time of day and the kind of symptoms that were seen at the beginning
2284,2284,and in that clinic theyll be doing a number of things um theyll be checking theyll be doing a ultrasound of the carotid arteries like your your father had um and theyll be doing a maybe a they might do a scan of your brain as well to check if theres any signs of a bleed there,theyll be doing a number of um of the your um and theyll a a do your to any signs of bleed,theyll be doing a number of um tests to assess the value of your um and theyll also have a series of auscultatory tests that do not impair your ability to detect any signs of bleed
2285,2285,but um theyll be doing a range of tests in a short time frame in order to exclude whether you have um any illness ok whether you have got any kind of stroke or mini stroke,a of in a in to exclude um any ok you of or stroke,a review of the literature in a hospital setting in order to exclude um and any ok if you are at risk of a heart or stroke
2286,2286,now if your symptoms return and they persist theyre prolonged then um you may need to attend a and e,if your return and theyre prolonged um you may need to,if your symptoms persist and theyre prolonged um you may need to be hospitalized
2287,2287,ok because um our presumptive working diagnosis is mini stroke or tia ok,ok because um our presumptive diagnosis mini or tia ok,ok because um our presumptive diagnosis was mini or tia ok
2288,2288,and if a mini stroke is prolonged then uh then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke and in that case that becomes even more of an emergency so were not talking about waiting one or two days we want you to go to hospital in that instance as soon as possible ok,if stroke prolonged uh then we end up might be stroke in case that not about one days we you to that soon as possible,if stroke is prolonged uh then we end up with a diagnosis that might be stroke in case that is not reported for about one or two days we urge you to stop that as soon as possible

2395,2395,perfect thank you for that ok so tell me what the problem is youve been having some difficulty breathing is that correct,perfect ok what problem some breathing is,perfect breathing is ok what is the problem some people think is not
2396,2396,perfect ok great now um um can can i just get you to do it again and just say ah this time,perfect ok um um can to do it and just ah,perfect ok um um can do it and just ah
2397,2397,ok fantastic brilliant ok um,ok ok,ok ok
2398,2398,uh john based on um how you look how youre talking to me and how youre breathing and the appearance and your wrist,john look youre talking to youre and wrist,john look youre talking to you and your wrist
2399,2399,um i dont feel that youre having a an an a life threatening uh allergic reaction,um i youre having an life threatening,um i youre having an extremely life threatening event
2400,2400,now its very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite its uh its a localised um uh inflammatory reaction that um is normal and that immediate reaction that redness and that maybe slight swelling is usually temporary,now very normal to have when you some kind its localised uh inflammatory reaction normal and that immediate reaction and that maybe slight swelling temporary,when you have some kind of inflammatory response its localised uh inflammatory reaction is normal and that immediate reaction seems to be temporary
2401,2401,what were worried about is when someone has um compromise of their breathing so you mentioned breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip thankfully i cant see any of that right now,what were worried about when someone has um of their so you mentioned difficulties and you mentioned swelling thankfully any of,we were worried about when someone has um of their own so you mentioned difficulties and you also mentioned swelling thankfully none of them were symptomatic
2402,2402,but thats the most urgent and most pressing thing that wed be watching out for,but thats the and most thing that wed be for,but thats the most important thing that wed should be looking for
2403,2403,given that it hasnt happened initially its unlikely to happen later ok we so we have like a stage one and stage two reaction for these types of bites,given happened its unlikely happen later we have like stage one and stage two these,given what happened its unlikely that it will happen later in life like stage one and stage two in these cases
2404,2404,and usually if youre gonna have the reaction it will happen straight away,youre gonna have it away,nevertheless youre gonna have to take it away
2405,2405,so we may be coming out of the danger zone now its um but im just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens so for example,so we may be out the danger zone now its but just going to you what signs are in case happens example,so we may be out of the danger zone now its not clear but we are just going to show you what signs are present in case this happens for example
2406,2406,right ok so when did this bee sting or bee bite occur,ok did this bite,ok did not cause this bite
2407,2407,you would have swelling of the lips difficulty breathing you might have something called stridor which is an inspiratory sound that you when youre trying trying to breathe it makes like a rasping sound like this ok,swelling of difficulty breathing you might something stridor which inspiratory you youre breathe it like a like ok,if you might have something stridor which is inspiratory when youre trying to breathe it like a normal person like ok
2408,2408,thankfully you dont have anything like that right now it seems to me like this is a localised allergic reaction,that right now it me like is allergic,that right now it seems to me like the patient is allergic
2409,2409,however if anything changes if anything deteriorates either make an appointment with us or go straight to a and e,however if changes if deteriorates make appointment us straight to and e,if the patient changes or deteriorates make an appointment with us straight to the gastroenterologist and e surgeon
2410,2410,um uh and in some cases if its if its uh progressing rapidly its better to go straight to a and e rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us ok,um uh in cases if uh progressing better to straight to a rather than to for a booked appointment us,um in cases if uh is progressing better to go straight to a hospital rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us
2411,2411,what id like you to do now is id like you to try and take some antihistamines,what id you to now id you and take antihistamines,what id you to do now id  you and take antihistamines
2412,2412,so you can buy them over the counter you can get piriton or chlorphenamine and you can take one tablet four milligrams um up to about six times a day ok,so can buy them the counter you get you take one four milligrams um up to about a,when you get home you take one or four milligrams of um up to about a week
2413,2413,or you can just take a one a day one whichever is your preference thats thats absolutely fine theres no no issue that should be enough to control this,or can a a day is your preference thats absolutely theres no to control this,or can a day be your preference thats absolutely theres no way to control this
2414,2414,um if the redness in your arm spreads and you it feels hot or you you know you have signs of any localised infection,the spreads you feels you know have localised,the disease spreads when you feel you know you have localised infection
2415,2415,we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic,need to other an,need to be aware of other factors associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications
2416,2416,and like i said if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing thats urgent and we need to process that action needs to be taken urgently,and like i if anything deteriorates breathing thats need needs to be taken urgently,like i said if anything deteriorates in breathing that need needs to be taken urgently
2417,2417,right ok um and your your lips dont seem swollen to me right now but do they which can you show me with your finger where you feel its swollen,um your your dont to right now do can your finger its swollen,um your finger and your toes dont need to be removed right now do you think that you can remove the finger because its swollen
2418,2418,did you have any other um queries or was there anything else that youre worried about,you have any other was there anything else about,however if you have any other complaints was there anything else about them
2419,2419,yeah thats thats over the yeah over the counter you dont need to any chemist will have it you dont need a prescription for that yeah its probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to get it via prescription,thats thats yeah counter any will have it you need prescription for that yeah cheaper than to get via,whilst thats not a counter to any drug that will have it you need a prescription for that drug yeah it is cheaper than to get it via prescription
2420,2420,ok um now um uh on the basis of what youve told me i dont think you need any allergy testing i think this is just a a straightforward localised reaction to a an insect bite,ok um now uh on basis of youve told me i dont think you need any allergy testing i think this is reaction bite,ok um now uh on the basis of what youve told me i dont think you need any allergy testing i think this is a reaction to bite
2421,2421,however if it was to happen that you know this youre youre having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non specific rashes we might need to think about blood testing i dont think were at at that moment yet ok,however was to know this youre having these kind of on basis or non might need to think about blood testing at moment yet,however it was important to know that if youre having these kind of symptoms on a daily basis or if non patients might need to think about blood testing at the moment yet
2422,2422,so uh but thats something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent pattern,thats in mind this becomes pattern,with this in mind this becomes a common pattern
2423,2423,ok then so well leave it like that for now ok im gonna leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions just for you to read about it i dont want you to panic but just for you to be aware what symptoms are,ok well leave now im gonna information anaphylactic for you to read about i want to but just for you what,ok well leave now im gonna provide information on anaphylactic procedures for you to read about when i want to but just for a little while to show you what is possible
2424,2424,if those kind of things happen get back to us,if those kind happen get back,if those kind of events happen they get back to normal
2425,2425,if youre feeling worried just have a lower threshold for having a chat with us sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down,feeling worried lower threshold having a with us sometimes you calm,feeling worried at a lower threshold having a conversation with us sometimes you feel completely calm
2426,2426,all right then john ok uh well well leave it like that come back to us if you have any further issues,right ok well leave like come back to us if you any issues,right now it is ok to leave like that and come back to us if you have any issues

2637,2637,so i can,so can,so can the patient
2638,2638,sure ok um and are you a uh are you a smoker at all,um and a are you at,um and a questionnaire are used to identify patients who are at risk
2639,2639,ok and ohh do you drink much alcohol,ohh drink much,ohh drink too much
2640,2640,ok and how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally,how much kind do do,how much of this kind do they do
2641,2641,ok thats good alright um so um,ok thats good alright um um,ok thats good alright um um
2642,2642,what uh i think were gonna need to do is were gonna need to bring you into one of our clinics examine and were gonna need to arrange some blood tests as well,what were gonna to do is were to of clinics examine and gonna to some tests,what we were gonna do is to go to a number of clinics to examine and we are gonna try to perform some tests
2643,2643,ok um so what what i want to do is the first question i have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why youve got this fever and these symptoms because theres no apparent reason from what youve told me,so what do the have my is a reason for this these because apparent youve told me,therefore what do the authors have to say there is a reason for this in these cases because it is apparent from what youve told me
2644,2644,theres no uh when someone has got fever and sweats we want to find out have they got chest infection have they got a throat infection,theres no uh when someone has got we to out have they got a infection,when someone has got a viral infection we want to find out if they have been infected when they got an infection
2645,2645,um and if we cant find a focus of infection then thats something that thats an outstanding question that needs to be answered ok,um cant find a infection thats something thats an outstanding question that needs answered,um cannt find a cure for this infection thats something thats an outstanding question that needs answered
2646,2646,ok alright sorry to hear that now um uh along with this fever and this any other symptoms at all,ok hear um along with symptoms,ok hear um along with other symptoms
2647,2647,um the second thing second factor is that youve recently come from uh vietnam,um from vietnam,um from vietnam
2648,2648,and youve had exposure to rural areas and we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well so um youre probably gonna need some blood tests,and youve had exposure rural areas and we need malaria other infections well so probably,we know that youve had exposure to malaria and other infections as well so malaria probably has a role
2649,2649,after youve been seen by somebody,after been seen by somebody,afterwards he had been seen by somebody else
2650,2650,um now the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you which is why were going to go go for the examination first,um urgency tests partly we when we which were to go,um urgency tests partly prevented us from deciding when we were ready to go
2651,2651,you come into one of our clinics in central london thats one option and then the the gp there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be,you into of our clinics thats and gp there you then decide how and things are to be,when you come into one of our clinics and gp is there you then decide how and what things are going to be
2652,2652,or if its inconvenient for you to come into central london because you youre living further out you could actually just attend a local a and e,or you to out could actually and,or if you wanted to find out more about it could actually be helpful and useful
2653,2653,im going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of test i think you need in the notes for this appointment so you could show that to them at reception,to up what my is and what kind test think you need in the this so you show that to them,to follow up what my experience is and what kind of test do you think you need in the context of this so that you show that to them
2654,2654,um ill be asking for something called thick and thin blood films to check for malaria,um be asking for called thin to,um should be considered when asking for a patient called thin to moderate
2655,2655,and inflammatory markers and things like those technical terms but theyll understand what that what im talking about,inflammatory things those technical theyll what what im about,inflammatory things are those technical problems theyll have to know what im about
2656,2656,but um i i dont think you can go into work uh until weve sorted this out and we we we need to sort this out sooner rather than later,i i think go into uh weve sorted out we need sort sooner than later,when we go into uh weve sorted out we need to sort out this sooner than later
2657,2657,ok,ok,ok
2658,2658,ok fine so what im going to do is i will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in,ok fine im going to do is send a to of admin team members to book,ok fine im going to send a questionnaire to all of the admin team members to book them
2659,2659,and if you can ring the number that i leave in your consultation notes after a few minutes and then theyll slot you in and then we can sort things out from there ok,if leave your minutes and sort things out,if necessary leave your minutes and sort things out

2849,2849,ok,ok,ok
2850,2850,and whats your diet like,and your like,and your experience is like no other
2851,2851,ok,ok,ok
2852,2852,all right um now um in terms of this headache uh obviously i havent been able to examine you or see you directly,right um um uh i able to examine see you directly,right um um uh i was able to see you directly
2853,2853,but um it sounds like it might be one of two things it could be an element of what we call tension headache,it it of things could element of what we call,it is possible that one of these things could be an element of what we call a malignancy
2854,2854,ok thats one possibility um and what makes that more likely is the fact that youve been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past ok um,thats one and makes that more is the fact that under and you a history anxiety in ok um,what makes that more important is the fact that under general anesthesia and if you have a history of anxiety in ok um
2855,2855,the other possibility is um migraine as well,possibility is,possibility of a duodenal switch is high
2856,2856,ok um and the fact what makes that more likely is the fact that its on one side and that youve got some sensitivity to light,ok um the fact more is fact that sensitivity,ok um the fact that more is known is due to increased sensitivity
2857,2857,ok so what what i think we can do is um i think we can give you some um generic pain relief,can do can you pain,can do can you manage pain
2858,2858,that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches ok so ill tell you what it is in a second,that would first migraine type headaches ok so ill tell it is in,it would be the first reported migraine type headache in ok so ill tell if it is in the literature
2859,2859,sure ok and um uh did the did the pain wake you up,ok uh did did up,ok uh did not do a follow up
2860,2860,and the other thing that i was gonna suggest is we maybe look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work,and the thing that i suggest is we maybe look things to try decrease the work,the main thing that i suggest is that we maybe look at other things to try to decrease the work load
2861,2861,so um the medication wise the things that wed start off first line if someone had migraine was to would be to start ibuprofen,the the things wed start off first if migraine was ibuprofen,the first of the things wed should start off first if the migraine was resolved with ibuprofen
2862,2862,and um uh that the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses ibuprofen so thats one thing we can start you can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like but the the ibuprofens um actually more effective for migraine,doses ibuprofen can a more than the doses ibuprofen so thing start can on well you the actually effective for migraine,the doses of ibuprofen can be a little more than the doses for the placebo and the dosages of placebo are not as effective as those of the acetaminophen but the dose at which they start can depend on how well you understand the actually effective treatment for migraine
2863,2863,and um yeah so the the guidelines have changed recently we used we before that we used to give paracetamol as first line but now its um ibuprofen or aspirin,and um yeah the the we used that used give as first line but its,and um yeah the method we used is the same one that used to give the first line but its more expensive
2864,2864,thats thing um the other thing id like you to do is maybe consider taking some time off work ok because if the headache is due to stress from work,thing um thing id like you do taking off if stress from,thing um  is an id like you do taking off if stress is absent from the brain
2865,2865,um maybe having a week off if you self certify that might help with things and id also like you to explore counselling options as well so theres a counselling service in your area that i can give you the link for for you to self refer,um having week off you that help things and also explore options as well theres a your that i give link for self,um having a week off can help improve things and also explore options as well as theres a chance to improve your health so that i give a link for self improvement
2866,2866,id like you to ok id like you to try that um what were gonna do is well have a follow up in a weeks time,like you to ok like you what gonna have follow weeks,like you are going to be ok like you what are you gonna have to follow up for weeks
2867,2867,as well as those two things other things id like you to do is to try and ensure that youre having a minimum of seven eight hours sleep at night every night and youre drinking a minimum of um one point five to two litres uh of water or fluids a day and thats not including coffee or tea,as well as two things other is to try youre of sleep night every drinking of one uh water or and thats not,the other is to try to get youre full of sleep at night every time drinking of one uh water or water and that doesnt work
2868,2868,all right because sometimes dehydration and you know uh fatigue can be causes of headaches as well um,all and uh as um,all patients  were well tolerated and uh as well as um
2869,2869,yeah so it that that that is um you know we need to rule those things out um lets lets try that,it that you need rule those things that,it is important that you know what you need to rule out those things that are potentially harmful
2870,2870,what what time did it wake you up,what did it wake,what did it mean to wake up
2871,2871,ok um and lets have a follow up appointment if were finding that things are not getting better we might need to arrange some blood tests or um look at uh other possibilities but well try that in the first instance,ok um if were things some blood um at uh that instance,ok um if there were some blood loss um at uh that instance
2872,2872,um if anything changes in the meantime or you get worried or things get worse feel free have a lower threshold for ringing us back and we can book you an appointment and we can reassess the situation,um if in or get or worse free have lower for and an and we situation,um patients who are overweight or obese get better or worse free air and have lower risk for hypoglycemia and anemia and we discuss this situation
2873,2873,ok no problem so therell be a summary of all of this in the notes um and ill also leave a link to some of the danger signs of symptoms of headaches in the notes if you can read through that in your own time that will just help you to have a bit more control over whats going on and understanding of what what what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor,problem be a summary all of this in and ill a link to of signs of in if read through time that will just you to have bit more control going of trigger you another,problem is that there should be a summary of all of this in the elderly and ill as well as a link to a list of signs of distress in patients if read through over time that will just enable you to have a bit more control going forward of the trigger and give you another clue
2874,2874,no problem ok so well well touch base in a weeks time with me or myself or one of the other doctors and we well take it from there ok,problem so well touch in weeks with me or myself or one other doctors and well from there ok,problem was not so well handled in two weeks with either me or myself or one or two other doctors and everything was well from there ok
2875,2875,brilliant ok then all right take care then all the best,ok then all care the,ok then all patients underwent intensive care at the hospital

3055,3055,um it its not possible for us to do that online i think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination and i i think you would need one quite urgently ok so the thing thats running in the back of my mind are um kind of a viral illnesses that can one can get with um sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel,um its not for us to i need into to examination think you would one quite urgently ok so thing thats running my mind are of viral that can can sort of mosquito bites or foreign,um its not necessary for us to translate this into a clinical examination but i think you would like one quite urgently ok so the first thing thats running through my mind are reports of viral infections that can be caused by sort of mosquito bites or foreign bodies
3056,3056,like um the other common thing around thailand it will be like some dengue but that would have like you would have some uh blood spots or bleeding or something which you dont have at the moment do you,like um be like some dengue that have you have some spots or something you dont do you,like um it may be like some dengue that have been reported and if you have some spots or something that you dont know what do you do

3059,3059,how would you describe how would you describe the rash,how you describe how describe,how do you describe how to describe this phenomenon
3060,3060,red and itchy ok so if you were to put a glass on top of the rash does that rash go away,red itchy so were put glass rash go,red flags were itchy so the patients were put on antibiotics and the rash began to go away
3061,3061,it goes away ok,away,away from home
3062,3062,ok so what we need to do need to urgently examine you and thats sometime today ok and um after our examination there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital but im not sure as yet so id like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible,need need to and thats sometime ok and um our examination a high that sometimes we need send hospital but im sure as like you seen in our as as possible,um our examination is a high risk that sometimes we need to send us to hospital but im sure that as you have seen in our hospital as soon as possible
3063,3063,so um ill recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor preferably in the next few hours time ok and um in any case if thats not available id like you to take yourself to alright any questions at all,so um ill need to urgently seen by doctor in the next time ok um in case if thats not like you to yourself to alright questions,so um if you need to urgently seen by a doctor in the next time ok um in case if thats not like you have to ask yourself to alright questions

3066,3066,but and then its the uh in meningitis you get a non blanching rash while in any kind of virus the rash usually goes away saying that we dont know whether these are the beginning stage so thats why id rather but i would rather you see a gp as soon as possible if uh weve got a slot available but if not i think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations ok,then its you get a non rash while the usually away that we know whether these are the stage why rather but rather you as soon possible if uh got a slot available but if not you be have some blood tests and examinations,while the rash usually goes away it is important that we know whether these are at the stage of the disease why rather but rather you should be discharged as soon as possible if uh has got a slot available but if not you may be able to have some blood tests and examinations

3160,3160,ok and uh now after we get those set of bloods we will find out if we can find anything in them if thats all clear then we would need to do a physical examination ok,and uh now we get those of will find if we find in if all clear then we would a physical examination ok,unfortunately now we get those of us who will find if we find any abnormalities in the examination and if all is clear then we would recommend a physical examination if everything is ok
3161,3161,we would need to then go in and do but theres nothing from what your history youve said that that we urgently warrant a physical examination at this point in time i think its a good idea to start off with a blood test and then take it from there,would need go in nothing from history we warrant physical examination in time i its good start off with blood test take from,we would need to go in and take nothing from our history if we warrant a physical examination in time i its a good start off with a blood test to take from us
3162,3162,obviously with palpitations or chest pain if you get thats more of a medical emergency you need to go to a and e for that ok if things change youve mentioned now your bowels are fine and youre not being sick so if thats the case its ok but if your you know bowels change or youre being sick again you need to get in touch with us ok,palpitations or chest pain if more of a go a if change now your bowels fine and youre not being sick so thats you know change or sick again need to with us,if you have more of a go or a change in symptoms and if you change now your bowels are fine and youre not being sick so thats a good sign that you know that change or get sick again and need to communicate with us

3692,3692,ok so right so after you know speaking and examining you know yourself i think its quite important that we do investigate it a bit further im just wondering whether theres something a bit more than just the boxing here,after speaking and examining know yourself i its quite important investigate it something more just the here,after speaking and examining it for yourself i think it is quite important to investigate it in something more than just the here and now
3693,3693,ok few things thats made me think other than just like a boxing injury is for instance um you know when you said you cant your vision went your peripheral vision was not there for about twenty so and that with the weakness of the arms make me think is there something else going on rather than just an injury,ok things made me than just like a boxing injury um know you cant went your vision was for about twenty so that the arms make think something on injury,other things made me feel more than just like a boxing injury um you know you cant go back to where your vision was for about twenty minutes so that the arms make you think something on the injury
3694,3694,sometimes you know you do get things like ms multiple sclerosis so people with multiple sclerosis can have um visual problems like what youve experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on ok,you you do things so visual problems like youve experienced and you the odd tingling sensations going on,however you do not do things so visual problems like youve experienced before and you have the odd tingling sensations going on
3695,3695,we if we capture it a bit early there are treatments for it ok im not obviously im not suggesting that you do have it but it is quite important to find out that whether you have it or not thats the most serious kind of thing that needs to be uh dealt with here,we if capture early for ok im not obviously im not that do have but it is quite to find of thing be here,if capture is not possible obviously im not aware of other cases that do have such a problem but it is quite difficult to find cases of this kind of thing that can be reported here
3696,3696,yeah so what we can do is im going to do an urgent very urgent neurology referral yeah what they what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that hello,we can is im going do urgent urgent yeah what what that might entail brain and things like that hello,if is im going to do urgent urgent surgery yeah what is what that might entail for the brain and things like that hello
3697,3697,mm hmm,hmm,hmm
3698,3698,i know this might sound a bit of a shock to you um but im i think it is more important that we investigate this a bit more seriously,this might of to you um but im i it more that we a bit more,im i it is more likely that we will need to learn a bit more
3699,3699,ok any questions at all,ok any questions,okay any questions were answered
3700,3700,no thats something we cant do the treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that uh when you have an acute you know acute reaction or things like that but saying that first we need to firm diagnosis,we cant do for some like that you have an know acute reaction like that that first we to diagnosis,for some patients like that if you have an acute reaction to a meal it is important that that first we are able to make a diagnosis
3701,3701,yeah while youre waiting for this to be done if theres any weakness uh you know if the weakness progresses to your legs or theres any kind of headaches vomiting fits and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better then that would be an a and e,yeah youre be done if theres any uh the progresses to legs or theres any kind headaches and worse and better that would be an e,however if theres any uh the bleeding progresses to the lower legs or if there is any kind of headaches and worse and better symptoms that would be considered an e

3811,3811,ok and thats correct and just to confirm that youre in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation,ok correct and just to youre secure have confidential,ok is correct and just to youre safe and have confidential information
3812,3812,yellow ok ill have to check that one not sure laxepro,have check that one laxepro,have to check that one patient received laxepro
3813,3813,ok um thats fine any other medication that youre using,um thats any youre using,um thats not any of the methods youre using
3814,3814,over the counter anything at all,over counter anything,over the counter opioids did not do anything
3815,3815,ok right any allergies,ok allergies,ok food allergies
3816,3816,no allergies at all righty fine so obviously you know you just have diarrhea its about four to five times a day um youre still drinking plenty and you look like youre not dehydrated which is a good sign ok um when we start worrying about diarrhea is if youre going more than eight times a day,all fine its four five a um plenty look youre not dehydrated which a good sign um start worrying diarrhea if going than,all of them were fine and its four or five times a um plenty to look forward to if youre not dehydrated which is a good sign when um start worrying about diarrhea if going slower than usual
3817,3817,that means probably you are you know whatever youre eating is going straight through ok you still need to drink plenty of water because youre losing a lot of fluids,that means you are you know whatever eating going straight ok plenty of because youre of fluids,if you know that whatever you are eating is going straight to ok there is plenty of room for improvement because youre full of fluids
3818,3818,ok when you go to the toilet um things that one would advise is a soft diet so avoid dairy fish meat eggs while youre having the diarrhea go sorry,ok go the toilet um things one is a soft diet so avoid fish while youre having,one way to go to the toilet um things one is a soft diet so avoid fish while youre having a meal
3819,3819,ok so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of things thats easily digested like what we are good give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple food for babies you dont give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding so thats the kind of soft diet were talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of it in you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash,so like toast thats easily digested what we are give yeah eating you food for babies you eggs or meat the time they so thats the kind diet were talking able you keep most of it start some just and,so like bread thats easily digested what we are trying to give yeah eating you food for babies you eat you eggs or meat at the time they are born so thats the kind of diet we were talking about and being able to keep most of it till they start eating some just bread and milk
3820,3820,once youre ok with that for about forty eight hours then you can start having meat so just dont have meat once you feel like youre slightly better because you might go back to square one again all right,once that eight you can having meat so have meat once you like youre slightly go back to one right,once you have that eight you can stop having meat so that one can have meat once you like it youre slightly able to go back to one right
3821,3821,forty eight hours youre not having any diarrhea youre fine then you can go and start having meat egg fish and all so that,hours having youre fine then can and meat egg fish and all that,hours after having eaten youre fine and then can eat meat egg fish and all that
3822,3822,ok uh youve mentioned on our notes that youre suffering from bad diarrhea im sorry to hear about it so if you tell me a bit more about it please,ok youve mentioned on our notes that youre bad diarrhea sorry to about so if me a bit more,ok youve mentioned on our notes that youre having bad diarrhea and sorry to complain about it so if you ask me a little bit more
3823,3823,no no no preferably just dont because what why do we say this its because it takes much more time for meat to get digested so because your gut flora you know the the the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food,no no dont do say this it time so because gut you know the the in your is not as should be it takes bit effort for these,this is it for the time being so because the gut you know the source of the pain in your body is not as clear as it should be it takes a bit of effort for these patients
3824,3824,while it doesnt take that much of an effort to you know digest mash and vegetables does that make sense,of an to you know digest mash and make,of course it is important to know how to digest mash and make a meal
3825,3825,yeah so um at the same time you could have some although you cant milk is not a good idea yoghurts are a good idea because they are probiotics it help to build up the normal um gut gut bacteria back,yeah so at the same have although milk is not a yoghurts a idea it to build normal um gut back,yeah so at the same time we have a hypothesis that although milk is not a yoghurts milk has a good idea it is necessary to build a normal um gut back
3826,3826,ok,ok,ok
3827,3827,so those kinda now things to look out for if your diarrhoea doesnt go away in a weeks time or if youre passing blood we need a stool sample because that means you you may have um some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics,so now look if your diarrhoea go away in a or if blood a sample that means you may have um some particular bugs that might need with antibiotics,if your diarrhoea does not go away in a month or if blood samples from a stool sample are negative that means you may have um some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics
3828,3828,ok if youre again as ive mentioned previously if youre going about six to eight times a day that means theres a high chance that uh you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time if that happens you get in touch with us again all right,if ive mentioned youre going about six a day that means that uh you having dehydration you might to go into hospital at you in touch with again right,if ive mentioned that youre going about six hours a day that means that uh you are having dehydration and you might have to go into hospital and at least one of you will be in touch with again right away
3829,3829,any questions you look a bit confused,any you look bit,anytime you look a bit tired
3830,3830,yeah ok and also you could get something called dioralyte over the counter so it helps to uh replenish your the salts that youve been thats lost through going to the toilet,ok also you get called dioralyte over the it uh your salts that youve been thats lost through the toilet,ok also you get called dioralyte over the toilet and it uh your salts that youve been drinking that thats lost through a toilet
3831,3831,ok if youre a bit confused you know you can actually uh all this is all recorded in your app so you can go back ill put that all in detail so if you know i know sometimes its a bit difficult to process everything you can go back and read read the notes,if youre a you know actually is all recorded can go ill put that all i everything can and read,if youre a reader you know that it actually is all recorded and can go ill put that all i and everything can be read
3832,3832,is that ok,is ok,is it ok

3902,3902,ok and are you allergic to anything,and are you allergic,however are you allergic
3903,3903,ok so let me summarise what youve told me already you were gardening a few hours ago and you experienced chest discomfort which was roughly seven out of ten,ok so summarise what youve already you gardening few hours and experienced chest discomfort which roughly seven out ten,ok so to summarise what youve already experienced you went gardening for a few hours and experienced chest discomfort which lasted roughly seven out of ten hours
3904,3904,and it feels more like someones sitting on your chest as opposed to pain,and it more someones on your as to pain,and it is more likely to have someones on your side as to the pain
3905,3905,and apart from this have you noticed anything else unusual specifically with your breathing,this have you noticed specifically with your,this may have you noticed specifically with your child
3906,3906,ok and is that getting worse or better,that getting worse,that is getting worse
3907,3907,and when you get short of breath when youre walking up the stairs have you noticed any pain,and when of up have you noticed any,never in the history of follow up have you noticed any abnormalities
3908,3908,ok so let me confirm you have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath is that correct,ok let me you the the moment you have shortness of is,ok let me remind you that the moment you have shortness of breath the procedure is difficult
3909,3909,hi my name is doctor gohill,name doctor,the name of the doctor
3910,3910,so given what youve told me about your past medical history i think it might be worth you calling an ambulance,so given me about past medical history it worth you ambulance,so given me the information about my past medical history it is worth mentioning that you should be referred to an ambulance
3911,3911,get you to the hospital as soon as possible because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart,you the as as because my is might something to do with heart,however you should consider the clinical presentation as well as the laboratory results because my experience is suggestive that this might have something to do with heart disease
3912,3912,so while to you i will ring an ambulance who should come to your address,while ring who should your,while the ring should be placed in your hand it is important to know the type of ring used and who should use it
3913,3913,but in the meantime i think we should stay on the phone so i can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics is that ok,but in meantime i think we stay i more information that to the,in the meantime i think that as we continue to stay in the study i will provide more information that will lead to the correct diagnosis
3914,3914,its nothing to worry about at the moment but given that youve got high blood pressure and high cholesterol and youve got some chest pain im always worried about the heart first before anything else,its to at the youve got blood cholesterol and some pain always worried the,its important to keep in mind that at the beginning youve got high blood pressure low cholesterol and some abdominal pain always worried about the pain
3915,3915,and we and we need to look after your heart before anything else,and we we need to look after before else,and we we need to look after each other before doing anything else
3916,3916,so apart from this light headedness and this chest discomfort have you noticed anything else unusual,so from this and chest discomfort you noticed anything,so far from this and chest discomfort you have not noticed anything
3917,3917,did you have anything to eat or drink this morning,did you to eat drink this morning,did you eat a drink this morning
3918,3918,and you feel still feel nauseous at the moment,and nauseous the,and nauseous in the stomach
3919,3919,so i have a couple of other questions to ask you and im gonna reel them off so apologies for not letting you talk very much,so i have couple of to you and im gonna reel for not letting very much,we have a couple of letters to you and im gonna reel them out for not letting you know very much

3928,3928,and do you live at home with your wife at the moment,and do live at home wife at moment,and do not live at home with his wife at the moment

3936,3936,so they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate so dont be worried,so will give of to through and things just to like blood your heart rate be worried,so you will give a lot of information to the doctors through history and things just to like blood tests and your heart rate will not be worried

4173,4173,ok,ok,ok
4174,4174,ok and how long ago was that just a few weeks,and long was a few weeks,the long term followup was a few weeks
4175,4175,ok and are you with baby at the moment,ok and you at,ok and you were at rest
4176,4176,and how is baby doing,how baby doing,how is the baby doing
4177,4177,ok any coughs or colds with uh them,coughs colds uh,coughs colds uh
4178,4178,ok so youve noticed shortness of breath for just an hour while sitting and watching tv,ok so noticed shortness of breath hour sitting and,ok so we noticed shortness of breath one hour after sitting and two hours after eating
4179,4179,and you had your c section a couple of weeks ago,and section a couple of,and section a couple of cases
4180,4180,and yesterday you noticed a cough,and you cough,and you cough
4181,4181,so talk to me about the cough have you bought anything up,talk to the have you bought up,talk to the company who have you bought up
4182,4182,good um my name is doctor gohil im one of the physicians that works here at babylon,um my is of the physicians works here babylon,um my experience is similar to that of the physicians who works here in babylon
4183,4183,and when was the last time you were ill with the flu or symptoms like this,and time were ill with the flu or symptoms this,no patients at this time were ill with the flu or symptoms of this disease
4184,4184,ok and this shortness of breath youre having is it getting worse,and this shortness of having it getting,and this shortness of time of having it is getting worse
4185,4185,ok so youre feeling your heart more than normal,feeling heart than,feeling heartburn was significantly lower than in controls 
4186,4186,and the shortness of breath does it cause any pain in your chest,and the breath does cause pain your,and the breath does not cause pain in your stomach
4187,4187,how about when you take a very deep breath in,when a very deep breath in,when a very deep breath was observed in the stomach
4188,4188,ok,ok,ok
4189,4189,and since your c section did you have to take any medications,and your section did you have take any,and in your section did you have to take any medications
4190,4190,all right and can you remember what the name of those were,all right can what were,all right can be used to describe what were encountered
4191,4191,and have you had to use that regularly,have had to use regularly,theyhave had to use aspirin regularly
4192,4192,ok and apart from the c section and the shortness of breath have you got any other medical problems i should know about,ok from the c of you got medical i should about,ok from the c point of view if you got medical problems i should know about them
4193,4193,may i confirm your name and date of birth please,may i name and date please,if i cannot name and date of death please contact us
4194,4194,and you were,and were,and the results were similar
4195,4195,ok,ok,ok
4196,4196,and what happens when you take ibuprofen,and what happens when you take ibuprofen,and what happens when you take ibuprofen
4197,4197,so i need you to do something for me have you measured the rate of your heart before,you do for me have you measured the your before,however you do not for me have you measured the size of your stomach before surgery
4198,4198,have you measured it recently either with an iwatch or something similar,have you recently iwatch or,have you recently used the iwatch or ivideo
4199,4199,ok we might need to do that over the phone so are you able to put your right hand on your left wrist just underneath your thumb and see if you can feel your heartbeat,we need that phone so are to put on your wrist just thumb and can your heartbeat,these devices are easy to put on your wrist just like your thumb and can mimic your heartbeat
4200,4200,so uh what i need you to do is when i count to three count down from three just count the number of beats youve noticed and ill tell you when to stop is that ok,so you do is to three count down count youve noticed ill tell you to stop is that,when all you do is to count down the count if youve noticed it ill tell you to stop but there is no evidence that it is necessary
4201,4201,so well start in three two one go,in three,in three patients 
4202,4202,great that should be enough how many did you count,great that enough many did you,greater numbers of patients that had undergone surgery were enough that many did not know that you were alive
4203,4203,good,good,good results
4204,4204,so your heart is running slightly fast at the moment which is probably because of the shortness of breath and some of the pain that youre under,so heart is fast moment which probably because of the shortness of breath and of that under,so heart rate is fast at any given moment which is probably because of the shortness of breath and of that under sedation
4205,4205,given that youve had a c section and youre short of breath which has come on quite recently and quite quickly,given that youve had c section short of which come recently,given that youve had a c section only a few of which have come recently
4206,4206,it might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out the bit further,it be worth going to checked out,it may be worth going to a specialist to get checked out
4207,4207,so theres two ways of us doing this the first is i can call an ambulance or you can take yourself to the hospital with baby,ways us the an the hospital with baby,ways of transport us to the an emergency department of the hospital with the baby
4208,4208,which one would you prefer,which one you prefer,which one do you prefer
4209,4209,sure and what i would suggest is go fairly quickly and take some bits for baby at the same time,sure and what i is go and take some bits the same,sure and what i am going to do is go and take some bits of the same
4210,4210,and if youre taking any medications like codeine dont dont take them for the time being,and youre like codeine take for time,and if youre like me codeine will take off for the first time
4211,4211,is anyone else with you at home,is else with home,is it better to treat someone else with home parenteral nutrition
4212,4212,ok,ok,ok
4213,4213,nineteen eighty three and are you in a space thats private and quiet and you can talk,three are a private quiet you,three of them are in a private quiet room with you
4214,4214,so i think thats the best thing to do for the time being,so thats to do the time,so thats what we have to do all the time
4215,4215,so what im worried about at the moment is given that youve had a c section,what worried about youve had section,what are you worried about if youve had a cecal section
4216,4216,some people can suffer with clots and those can either be found in the legs or your chest so in your lungs,people and those can either be in the legs your lungs,people and those can either be in the legs or in your lungs
4217,4217,its quite a common thing to happen and its not something to worry about but needs to be checked out in the hospital first,quite common happen and something to worry needs to be checked in the hospital,nausea is quite common to happen and something to worry about needs to be checked in the hospital
4218,4218,and if it if that does become the case they can give you something to reduce the clot,the case can you something reduce the,the case report can help you find something to reduce the risk
4219,4219,fairly quick process,process,the process was performed by a single process
4220,4220,good are you uh are you particularly worried about anything or do you want to ask me anything before we go,are you are you particularly worried about anything or want we go,are you particularly worried about anything or want to go home

4317,4317,hay fever this could be one of two things,hay fever this could be one of two,hay fever this could be one of two
4318,4318,but we want to rule out asthma or an allergy first,we want asthma an first,we want to consider asthma as an important first line of treatment
4319,4319,so what youll need is visit one of our clinics so we can do some more tests,youll need one our we can do more,we’ll need one of our own if we can do more

4404,4404,have you had to drink more water than normal,have to more normal,theyhave been reported to be more normal
4405,4405,an important question have you noticed any blood,an important you noticed blood,an important factor you noticed was blood loss
4406,4406,and you mentioned tummy pain can you tell me more about your tummy pain like where it is and if it goes anywhere,and tummy can you tell your where if goes,however how can you tell where if a tumour goes
4407,4407,yep,yep,yep
4408,4408,ok youve been able to eat and drink,been eat,they have been unable to eat
4409,4409,hmm and you said the tummy pains in the middle of your tummy does it go anywhere else,and you said the tummy in the go anywhere else,the tummy did not go anywhere else
4410,4410,can i can i check your name and date of birth please,can i check your and of birth please,can i check your age and sex of birth please
4411,4411,ok and when was the last time you vomited,ok when the last vomited,ok when the last patient vomited

4414,4414,did you notice any blood when you vomit,did notice any blood you,we did not notice any blood loss in any of you
4415,4415,ok and um did you eat anything that you think might of been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain,think or anything that,don’t think or do anything that is wrong
4416,4416,yeah,yeah,yeah
4417,4417,ok,ok,ok
4418,4418,ok,ok,ok
4419,4419,ok,ok,ok
4420,4420,ok its very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this normally its when you eat um bad food or food that has gone off and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested but just to double check have you noticed any problems with your breathing,very to cause tummy pain like when eat um food that and you normally get symptoms like you have have noticed any problems with breathing,very few people have been able to cause tummy pain like when they eat um food that is ingested and you normally get symptoms like constipation but you have not have noticed any problems with breathing
4421,4421,ok,ok,ok
4422,4422,ok and how about chest have you noticed any chest pain,ok chest noticed pain,ok chest pain was noticed more frequently in patients with abdominal pain
4423,4423,ok and how about um walking and talking are those all both ok,ok how about um those both,ok how about um and those of both groups
4424,4424,yep and when you press on your tummy does it cause any pain,when you your it any pain,when you look at your abdomen it does not show any pain
4425,4425,ok,ok,ok
4426,4426,sorry i was just writing some things down,sorry i just down,sorry i just went down
4427,4427,so what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and its causing your tummy pain and its this is normally called gastroenteritis so an infection of the tummy,so what to me might have and its causing and its this is so an of,however what to me might have contributed to its causing and its influence on this disease is not so clear and an analysis of the literature is needed
4428,4428,normally when patients have this do some things number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because youre losing lots at the moment number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers so if you start getting a temperature then you need,normally when have this do some number is drink youre number to sure and look out so getting then you need,when you have this problem do some number is required to drink youre number to be sure and look out so that you are getting the information then you need
4429,4429,and please stay home for the time being until you get slightly better,and home the time being you get better,and home for the time being you will get better
4430,4430,ok and are you in a space thats quiet and youre able to talk,ok in a space thats quiet and able,ok in a space that is quiet and able to communicate
4431,4431,and normally,normally,normally the patient was discharged
4432,4432,normally things like antibiotics dont help they make the situation worse,normally things like dont help they the situation,normally things like antibiotics dont help they worsen the situation
4433,4433,so thats,thats,thats the problem
4434,4434,go ahead,ahead,theahead
4435,4435,so i think thats what we should do for the time being if you feel youre getting much worse than i would suggest you go and see your gp in real in real life in person so they can loot at your belly,i think the getting worse than would you go and see gp in real life person can loot your belly,if the situation is getting worse than it would be if you go and see gp in real life a person can loot your belly
4436,4436,great cool do you have any more questions for me,great cool you have any questions for,great cool if you have any questions for us
4437,4437,yes,yes,yes
4438,4438,so the the things that youve told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had but if your things dont get worse then thats something that we can look up from the gp,the the things that youve told me are an tummy something your father but if your dont something that we up from gp,the things that youve told me are an tummy or something from your father but if your parents dont know about it it is probably something that we picked up from gp
4439,4439,does that sound ok,that ok,that was ok
4440,4440,thank you,thank you,thank you
4441,4441,so youre forty eight and are you able to talk at the moment,so able to talk,so they were able to talk

4547,4547,so yes a migraine yeah no you know even sooner than that we can look at maybe half an hour to forty minutes depending on what your response to it is for some people,a no look half on what to is for some,a look in the other half of the literature on what to do is recommended for some patients
4548,4548,uh whatever medications they take the migraine doesnt improve um and they can last from anywhere from four hours to seventy two hours migraines can last um but,whatever they take migraine improve and they can last anywhere from four hours seventy hours migraines can,whatever they take migraine symptoms can improve and they can last anywhere from four hours to seventy hours but migraines can be lifethreatening
4549,4549,no so what theres lots of medication treatments so theres it can be ibuprofen with an anti sickness um so and which you can get from the pharmacy,no so theres lots of medication so it be with anti the pharmacy,theres lots of medication so it should be done with antihypertensive agents at the pharmacy

4943,4943,sure yeah ok but youre not short of breath at rest at the moment,yeah but short at the,yeah but short at the end of the day
4944,4944,ok fine so what what i think um and just to just to go over is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the uh a prescription for your inhalers was there anything else youd hoped about getting from this,fine so what i think and just to is anything you hoped about getting than uh a for your anything else youd hoped about getting,in conclusion what i think is that there is more to do for anything you hoped about getting than uh a chance for your parents to see you than anything else youd hoped for getting
4945,4945,sure yeah no absolutely well im really glad you have talked to me today i think what we can do is is give you a prescription for uh some more of the inhalers we can get that to you within the hour i would hope,sure absolutely well talked to i think what can do is you a prescription for uh some inhalers can that you within the would hope,surely if you are absolutely well talked to i think what can do is give you a prescription for uh some inhalers can be used that will get you within the range that you would hope
4946,4946,um and uh i think what the other thing id like to do is just give you a dose of steroids so this is these are tablets which um you can take for five days uh two tablets in the morning,think other thing like to just give a dose so this these are tablets take five days two in the morning,we think the other thing like to just give a dose so this time these are tablets that take five days and two hours in the morning
4947,4947,and uh that should just dampen down your asthmatic response ok,uh dampen,uh dampen
4948,4948,um now there are some side effects to the steroids which i should really tell you about but please read the label thats associated with dont be too worried about the side effects,now there are side to the tell you read the thats associated with be too effects,if you read the literature thats associated with obesity may be too subjective to identify side effects
4949,4949,theyre most you know most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated and uh you have you had them in the past do you know of,you time the are well had do of,however at this time the patients are well and had a good do of life
4950,4950,have you had steroids in the past,have you steroids in the,have you used steroids in the past
4951,4951,probably yeah i would too so um they they can come they can make you your mood change can be slightly low or too slightly high,probably yeah i too can can make your mood change be slightly high,probably yeah i too can can make your mood change be slightly high
4952,4952,can give you a high blood sugar um and uh their uh they can also cause rash nausea um headaches but mostly is well tolerated and it should help your asthma an awful lot,a blood uh they can also cause rash um headaches but well should your an awful lot,a lot of blood uh they can also cause rash um headaches but well they should be considered in your everyday life an awful lot

4954,4954,um uh what id like to do is is send you these the some prescriptions for your uh inhalers ongoing so you um you can once you get better from this asthma attack you can you can use the clenil modulite in the morning with ventolin as a prn so a ventolin when you need to um when youre getting wheezy,uh id like to do is you these for your uh ongoing you um you once better from attack you use the clenil modulite in ventolin as a prn so a ventolin you um,what we would like to do is to remind you that if you use these modulite for your uh ongoing therapy you um you once better recover from the attack you should use the clenil modulate in the ventolin as a prn so that you have a better understanding of what is going on in your home and what you are doing um
4955,4955,if you should start to use the ventolin more than uh every three hours,you should start use ventolin than uh three hours,nevertheless you should start to use ventolin more frequently than uh three hours after surgery
4956,4956,uh at at anytime its a good idea to seek medical attention so um see a doctor um in some capacity,uh anytime its to medical attention so um see a um in capacity,uh anytime its needed to be given medical attention so um we see a definite increase in um in capacity
4957,4957,uh and the other thing id like to send you is a spacer which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better have you do you know what a spacer is have you used one before,uh other thing id like send you is a spacer would the medication your lungs better have you do you spacer is have used one before,if id like to send you a spacer it would be better to use the medication in your lungs better have you do what you have to do and if you are not using one a sspacer is best to have used one before

5824,5824,um and we should also check that youre not getting dehydrated because if youre if youre not keeping fluid down then you can get dehydrated,and should check youre dehydrated because if youre not down you can dehydrated,and gastroenterologists should check if youre dehydrated because if the blood pressure does not go down you can be dehydrating
5825,5825,um so,um,um
5826,5826,yeah so you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts its a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago so youre obviously still um hydrated enough to pass urine,yeah need carry on with your rehydration and have its positive sign that urine an hour ago still um enough to pass,yeah you need to carry on with your rehydration and have its positive sign that urine an hour ago was still um enough to pass

5829,5829,um so we can we can make you an urgent appointment um and then you can you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration um but if in the meantime youre feeling more unwell then we would get you seen urgently in a and e,so can can make an urgent and then you you the sent off can your hydration if in meantime more we would you seen urgently in and e,then you can see that you have the tube sent off and can resume your hydration if in the meantime more and more we would like you to be seen urgently in hospital and egypt

6071,6071,ok um what i can do is i can prescribe you a peak flow meter so we can check your breathing level and a spacer to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up,um i do is can peak flow so can and a to use your inhaler a more which the pharmacist you how you when pick it up,um i do not believe that the inhaler can achieve peak flow so it can be used safely and with a good tolerance to use your inhalers in a more controlled manner which allows the pharmacist and you to decide how you will use it when you pick it up
6072,6072,um and if you increase it so youre taking it two to four puffs like every four hours,and if increase youre to four puffs like,if you increase the youre to four puffs like a normal meal

6077,6077,ok and the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine,and thing do would be regular antihistamine,the first thing to do would be to use a regular antihistamine
6078,6078,which you can get from the pharmacy i can put a on your notes about what to take,from the pharmacy i notes about,from the pharmacy i notes about the patient
6079,6079,and then if you when you get the peak flow meter if you can take the pharmacist can show you how to use it and if you can record a value first thing when you wake up,and when you get meter you can take the you and you can record value,when you get a meter you can take the data from the you and you could record the value

6196,6196,um,um,um
6197,6197,sorry um so with this rash we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms and just because of your symptoms which have been ongoing for six weeks thats obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels,sorry um this we would to has been a contributing factor of your symptoms which have six weeks quite in,sorry um this is the first time we would like to suggest that obesity has been a contributing factor of your symptoms which have persisted for six weeks quite in some cases
6198,6198,um i think its important to get some blood tests checking all the normal things like liver kidneys blood count etc but also some more specific things like um a bacterial infection you can sometimes get uh including one which you can get which can produce a rash like that so that would involve blood tests are you happy to do that,think its important to get blood checking all the normal things like liver kidneys blood count etc but also some more specific um bacterial you sometimes uh including one which which can produce a like that would involve blood you happy do that,we think its important to get blood checked for all the normal things like liver kidneys blood count etc but also some more specific um bacterial infections that you sometimes have uh including one which can produce a leak like that that would involve blood which makes you happy to do that
6199,6199,well you can get uh you can get a bacterial infection caused which is called um its called lyme disease that you can get a rash like that from a tick bite,uh you get bacterial caused which called um its lyme disease can a,uh you get bacterial overgrowth caused by um and its lyme disease which can result in a severe infection
6200,6200,ok um so when do you think you were last well,ok um so when think were last,ok um so when do we think of the last time
6201,6201,so thats something we would do a test for as well um and if that comes back positive then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it,something we a and that positive are we would give you to treat it,if there is something that we can identify in a patient and that is positive we would give you the opportunity to treat it
6202,6202,so its definitely worth checking for but we would also check just for which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching for persistent over six weeks,so definitely worth checking for but we would also just can cause reduced for over six weeks,we would also like to point out that just about any disease can cause reduced quality of life for over six weeks
6203,6203,so if youre happy to do that if you book that through the support line and then when youve had the test arrange a follow up about a week after after youve had the test done,so to do that you that through the support youve had arrange a follow up week after youve test,we recommend that you that through the support youve had to arrange a follow up one week after the outcome of the youvi test

6433,6433,ok and any problems with your stomach or asthma indigestion acid reflux,ok any problems acid,ok was not associated with any problems with acid intake
6434,6434,and what i would suggest is definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that youve been using so as much as you can cause that really does make a difference to injuries,and i would suggest is definitely ice therapy using much you cause that really does a injuries,it is definitely ice therapy using much of what you cause that really does a good job of treating these injuries
6435,6435,brings the healing blood into the area and it gives it the best chance of getting better so as much as you can use the ice,the healing blood the gives it the of getting better so much as can the,the healing of the blood gives it the hope of getting better so much as can the pain
6436,6436,um obviously youre trying to stick to a marathon programme but,um trying to a marathon but,um was trying to complete a marathon but failed
6437,6437,um i would try and ease up on the running if you can and if it if its painful enough that youre having to stop running then its not a good idea to do that,i and ease on the if you can and if it enough youre having to stop running idea to do,i and ii ease the pressure on the device if you can and if it is enough youre not having to stop running the idea of what to do
6438,6438,um its fine to take the ibuprofen um i can prescribe you a slightly stronger anti inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the ibuprofen but not with the ibuprofen,um its the um a slightly stronger that but ibuprofen,um its efficacy was similar to the um but a slightly stronger than that of ibuprofen
6439,6439,but make sure that with food ultimately we probably need to examine the knee,sure with food we to examine knee,sure with food we tried to examine the knee
6440,6440,um so the best thing i would suggest getting a appointment with the physiotherapist first who can do like a long assessment and examination of the knee,the i would a with the physiotherapist can do a long and the knee,the i would recommend a consultation with the physiotherapist who can do a long and detailed examination of the knee
6441,6441,and then we can make an assessment as to whether we need to do any um imagery to have a look inside the knee and see if theres any problem with the cartilage,and can an assessment as we to um imagery the see theres,we aim to provide um imagery to the patients to see theres
6442,6442,ok thats fine so when do you think it started,ok thats when do,ok thats when the questions do arise
6443,6443,um its its not really possible to diagnose that over the over the video so we definitely would need to see you and the a physio is the best point of call because theyll probably be the most likely initial treatment,over over the video we definitely see the a the best point of probably be initial,over time over the video we definitely see a trend towards a more aggressive approach and the best point of view will probably be the initial evaluation
6444,6444,but certainly if the appointment times too long to wait then we can see we can see you in our clinic as well,but certainly too long can see clinic well,but certainly too long can see the clinic as well
6445,6445,yep we can we can do a referral before that if in the meantime you develop like persistant swelling heat redness um of the knee or high temperature feel unwell or it completely locks up and you cant bend and stretch it,yep can can do referral that in meantime develop redness um the high or locks and you cant and it,in the meantime you develop redness um in the high or low locks and you cant stop it
6446,6446,then youd need to see a doctor urgently so call us back in that case,then to a doctor urgently call back in,then she was referred to a doctor who urgently needed to call back in
