2852,all right um now um in terms of this headache uh obviously i havent been able to examine you or see you directly,myelencephalon bight   um in terms gov top biss headache Lemuroidea obviously i havent  92 abel to examine you or   directly,myelencephalon might be helpful in terms of this headache obviously i have to be able to examine you or your family directly
2853,but um it sounds like it might be one of two things it could be an element of what we call tension headache,cut um bit derivation bike it might ab bun of two brings could be an element of what brambly  youthfulness gentian ,but um it might be one of two that could be an element of what is called gentian syndrome
2854,ok thats one possibility um and what makes that more likely is the fact that youve been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past ok um,a. thats one possibility bum  abut that more likely ms the fact that youve adin  alum venturesome pressure and ado halve a history of anxiety  Purcell the ok um,a. thats one possibility but what is more likely is the fact that youve been suffering from pressure and who have a history of anxiety during the ok um
2855,the other possibility is um migraine as well,the other possibility bum  baz well,the other possibility is gastrointestinal as well
2856,ok um and the fact what makes that more likely is the fact that its on one side and that youve got some sensitivity to light,ok um and the pact what aches Cepheus  abor reichley ms break the that its bon lifeline bun  and that youve got some sensitivity to,ok um and what makes it more likely is the fact that its on one side and that youve got some sensitivity to it
2857,ok so what what i think we can do is um i think we can give you some um generic pain relief,a. so what  i  ab can do weirdness bum i think  emasculate can give you   barrick pain skin,so what do i think we can do about bum pain and so do we think that emasculate can give you relief from pain of skin
2858,that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches ok so ill tell you what it is in a second,that could be  appropriate depp for migraine type  crith ok au ill  abut it is  refutation a second,that could be an appropriate start for migraine type ii but no ill effect what it is worth is a second opinion
2859,sure ok and um uh did the did the pain wake you up,sure ok and bum uh did the bid XXIII the pain ache pair up,sure ok and bum uh did the rest of the pain ache pair up
2860,and the other thing that i was gonna suggest is we maybe look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work,and the uther thing  divergence was gonna  ms  maybe book explore things do try and decrease the stress from berk,and the other thing that was gonna happen is to maybe explore things to try and decrease the stress from work
2861,so um the medication wise the things that wed start off first line if someone had migraine was to would be to start ibuprofen,so the  wise things that bed start off bumf dif someone had accutane was cash would be  ahart ibuprofen,so the only wise things that could start off bumf if someone had a migraine was what would be the heart rate and ibuprofen
2862,and um uh that the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses ibuprofen so thats one thing we can start you can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like but the the ibuprofens um actually more effective for migraine,and um ca that the doses gov ibuprofen  accompanied ab a fit abor the breaker formal doses  so thats one thing can start you can keep on aching paracetamol as well if you like but the the ibuprofens bum unusually more affective for accutane shooting,and um ca that the doses of ibuprofen are accompanied by a dose more than the normal doses are so that one thing can start and you can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like but the levels of the ibupsrofens are unusually more effective for migraine
2863,and um yeah so the the guidelines have changed recently we used we before that we used to give paracetamol as first line but now its um ibuprofen or aspirin,and um yeah so the the guidelines have arranged fieldhand recently ab used we before batt ab fused  paracetamol    melatonin  trim um ibuprofen cor aspirin,and um yeah so the guidelines have changed and recently be used we before that we used naproxen paracetamol ibuprofen or melatonin or aspirin
2864,thats thing um the other thing id like you to do is maybe consider taking some time off work ok because if the headache is due to stress from work, thing um the orison imaginary thing id  control to do  bidder aching ok because  the backache is ado do stress work,the thing um the orison thing id not control to a certain extent because of the headache is due to stress work
2865,um maybe having a week off if you self certify that might help with things and id also like you to explore counselling options as well so theres a counselling service in your area that i can give you the link for for you to self refer,bedeck  calving a baek off dif  helf acidify  optometrist might help  things and id also like ado do antiwar counselling options  well au theres a counselling smoothbore service in your area batt y can live ado years the link  shoulder cor ado emboss to self ,bedeck patients having a leak off if a helf scan might help prevent these things and id also like new approaches to counselling options as well as no theres a counselling service in your area that can give new years the link to care for new patients to self help
2866,id like you to ok id like you to try that um what were gonna do is well have a follow up in a weeks time, like ado  venturi ok id like ado to try that  HDTV  do is well have  follow in a beaks meiotic beim,like two others ok id like two to try that what they do is well tolerated and have a follow up in a few weeks time
2867,as well as those two things other things id like you to do is to try and ensure that youre having a minimum of seven eight hours sleep at night every night and youre drinking a minimum of um one point five to two litres uh of water or fluids a day and thats not including coffee or tea,baz Chalcididae baz those things things  bike  to do ms do try and allure that  calving a minimum gov bevan procumbent abate hours sleep every night and youre  conservator a polish  of um one point five do ado litres of lawter or fluids a aaa and thats not  coffee or ,as far as those things things go the first thing to do is to try and ensure that patients having a minimum of seven eight hours sleep every night and youre receiving a polish diet of um one point five to two litres of water or fluids a day and thats not including coffee or tea
2868,all right because sometimes dehydration and you know uh fatigue can be causes of headaches as well um,all bight  sometimes and ado know fatigue ab cryolite of headaches as well bum,all might complain sometimes and who know fatigue may be a cause of headaches as well
