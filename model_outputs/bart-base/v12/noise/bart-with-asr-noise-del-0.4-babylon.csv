165,um i think its important to get some blood tests checking all the normal things like liver kidneys blood count etc but also some more specific things like um a bacterial infection you can sometimes get uh including one which you can get which can produce a rash like that so that would involve blood tests are you happy to do that,um i important get some checking all the blood count etc but also more things like um bacterial infection you including can get which can rash that would involve are you to do that,um i think its important to get some checking done um all the blood count etc but also more things like um bacterial infection you can get which can cause a rash that would involve your skin are you going to do that

167,ok um so when do you think you were last well,um so when do you well,um so when do you get well
168,so thats something we would do a test for as well um and if that comes back positive then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it,so thats something we would a for um and back then there are specific antibiotics you it,so thats something we would need a prescription for um and back then there are specific antibiotics you can take for it
169,so its definitely worth checking for but we would also check just for which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching for persistent over six weeks,so worth but would also for which cause reduced tiredness aching for over six weeks,so that would be worth it but i would also recommend steroids for migraine which would cause reduced tiredness aching for over six weeks
170,so if youre happy to do that if you book that through the support line and then when youve had the test arrange a follow up about a week after after youve had the test done,if to that if and then when had test arrange a follow a after had the test done,if you need to do that if and then when you had the blood test arrange a follow up appointment after youve had that test done
