515,515,fine ok um so really just uh moving on um,fine um so just moving on um,fine um so just moving on um
516,516,and so based based on your story really uh uh kim its its its difficult its its um you know youve got some tummy pain you dont exactly know whats causing it it could be a few different things that could be causing your pain,and so based based on its difficult its its um know youve got some tummy you dont exactly know whats causing it it could be different things that could be causing your pain,and so based on its difficult nature its possible that um you know youve got some tummy but you dont exactly know whats causing it it could be different things that could also be causing your pain
517,517,could just be a you know could just be a urine infection for example could just be something related to your gut um could just be something related to your you know a pregnancy related cause um and so its probably worth doing some tests initially,be could just be urine infection for related to your gut um just be something related to your you know a related cause probably worth doing tests,be could just be urine infection for reasons related to your gut um or it could be something related directly toyour gut and you know a related cause probably worth doing tests
518,518,to try and rule out um whats going on here um which i can organize for you today,and out um whats on here um which can for you,and find out um whats going on here um which can be useful for you
519,519,um and basically those tests we well have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed but certainly it if its been going on for the last couple of days um,um and those tests we well have a idea in terms of how we should proceed it its going on the last couple of days um,um and those tests we well have a idea in terms of how we should proceed it its been going on the last couple of days um
520,520,uh you know its probably maybe worth empirically treating you for a maybe urine infection and so its an,uh you know its probably maybe worth empirically for a urine so its an,uh you know its probably maybe worth empirically for a urine test so its an important question
521,521,yeah absolutely so um i think its certainly worth you know covering you with some antibiotics today,so um i its certainly worth you know some antibiotics,so um i its certainly worth you know some antibiotics
522,522,uh but i still want you to bear in mind you know have a pregnancy test done to make sure were not missing anything else here,uh but i want you to bear in mind you know a test done make missing anything here,we want you to bear in mind that you know that a test done to make sure you are missing anything here
523,523,and um and i want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting any better or indeed if theyre getting worse,and um and you of come back and see me in a few days time your are getting any better or indeed if theyre worse,and um and you of course will come back and see me in a few days time if your symptoms are getting any better or indeed if theyre worse
524,524,so things to look out for would be you know worsening tummy pain um if youre feeling really hot or sweaty your temperatures not coming down um vomiting et cetera does that make sense,so things to look out for be know worsening pain um if youre feeling hot sweaty your not down et cetera does,to be know worsening pain um if youre feeling hot sweaty your not down et cetera does it matter

2399,2399,um i dont feel that youre having a an an a life threatening uh allergic reaction,i feel that youre having a an an threatening uh reaction,i feel that youre having a rather an aggressive or threatening uh reaction
2400,2400,now its very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite its uh its a localised um uh inflammatory reaction that um is normal and that immediate reaction that redness and that maybe slight swelling is usually temporary,now its have rash when have kind of insect bite its uh its a um that normal and that that redness and that slight swelling is temporary,now its possible to have rash when you have kind of insect bite its uh its a um that is normal and that that redness and swelling is temporary
2401,2401,what were worried about is when someone has um compromise of their breathing so you mentioned breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip thankfully i cant see any of that right now,worried is someone has um compromise of their breathing you mentioned breathing difficulties you lip thankfully i cant see any of that now,if someone has um compromise of their breathing you mentioned breathing difficulties and you lip thankfully i cant see any of that now
2402,2402,but thats the most urgent and most pressing thing that wed be watching out for,but the most urgent most pressing thing that out for,but the most urgent and most pressing thing is to find out what to look for
2403,2403,given that it hasnt happened initially its unlikely to happen later ok we so we have like a stage one and stage two reaction for these types of bites,given that hasnt its unlikely happen later we we like stage one and stage two reaction of,given that it hasnt been proven that its unlikely to happen later we we like to describe stage one and stage two reaction of the two groups
2404,2404,and usually if youre gonna have the reaction it will happen straight away,and usually youre gonna the it will happen straight,and usually youre gonna get the gist and it will happen straight away
2405,2405,so we may be coming out of the danger zone now its um but im just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens so for example,so we may be coming the danger zone now but im just going to you what those symptoms are in case so,so we may be coming out of the danger zone now but im just going to show you what those symptoms are in case of so
2406,2406,right ok so when did this bee sting or bee bite occur,right so when did this sting or bee bite occur,right so when did this sting or bee bite occur
2407,2407,you would have swelling of the lips difficulty breathing you might have something called stridor which is an inspiratory sound that you when youre trying trying to breathe it makes like a rasping sound like this ok,would swelling of the lips difficulty breathing you might something called stridor is an inspiratory sound that when youre trying to breathe it like a like,would swelling of the lips cause difficulty breathing you might think that something called stridor is an inspiratory sound that when youre trying to breathe it sounds like a nasogastric tube like
2408,2408,thankfully you dont have anything like that right now it seems to me like this is a localised allergic reaction,thankfully dont have like right to me like this is a localised allergic reaction,thankfully we dont have like right evidence to prove that this is a localised allergic reaction
2409,2409,however if anything changes if anything deteriorates either make an appointment with us or go straight to a and e,if changes if deteriorates an appointment or go to a and e,if this changes if the patient deteriorates an appointment or go to a dietitian and e
2410,2410,um uh and in some cases if its if its uh progressing rapidly its better to go straight to a and e rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us ok,um uh and in if its if its uh progressing rapidly better to go straight a and rather wait for a booked us ok,um and in fact if its not clear if uh is progressing rapidly it would be better to go straight to a hospital and rather wait for a booked us ok
2411,2411,what id like you to do now is id like you to try and take some antihistamines,what id like you to do now id like you and take some antihistamines,what id would like you to do now id like me and take some antihistamines
2412,2412,so you can buy them over the counter you can get piriton or chlorphenamine and you can take one tablet four milligrams um up to about six times a day ok,so can them over counter you can get chlorphenamine and you take four milligrams um up to about times a day,so you can get chlorphenamine and you take four milligrams um up to about three times a day
2413,2413,or you can just take a one a day one whichever is your preference thats thats absolutely fine theres no no issue that should be enough to control this,or just take a one day one is your preference thats thats fine no should be enough to this,or just take a one day one week if your preference thats fine no medication should be enough to prevent this
2414,2414,um if the redness in your arm spreads and you it feels hot or you you know you have signs of any localised infection,um if redness your spreads and you have signs of any infection,um if redness in your skin spreads and you have signs of any infection
2415,2415,we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic,we may other treatments like an,we may consider other treatments like an endoscopy
2416,2416,and like i said if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing thats urgent and we need to process that action needs to be taken urgently,like if anything in terms your and need to that action needs to be taken urgently,like if there is anything in terms of your symptoms and need to be addressed that action needs to also be taken urgently
2417,2417,right ok um and your your lips dont seem swollen to me right now but do they which can you show me with your finger where you feel its swollen,right your your lips dont swollen to me right now do they which can you show with where you feel,right now your lips dont seem swollen to me right now do they which can you show with where you feel

2419,2419,yeah thats thats over the yeah over the counter you dont need to any chemist will have it you dont need a prescription for that yeah its probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to get it via prescription,yeah thats yeah the counter you dont to will have dont need a prescription for that yeah probably cheaper to buy it over to get it via,yeah thats yeah the counter you dont need to will have a prescription for that yeah it is probably cheaper to buy it over to get it via the pharmacy
2420,2420,ok um now um uh on the basis of what youve told me i dont think you need any allergy testing i think this is just a a straightforward localised reaction to a an insect bite,um now uh on basis of youve me need any allergy testing i this is just a straightforward localised reaction an insect bite,um now uh on the basis of youve me did not need any allergy testing i this is just a straightforward localised reaction to an insect bite
2421,2421,however if it was to happen that you know this youre youre having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non specific rashes we might need to think about blood testing i dont think were at at that moment yet ok,if it was to that you know youre youre having kind of on a regular basis non specific rashes we might need to think blood testing think were at that yet ok,if it was to be believed that you know youre having this kind of bleeding on a regular basis non specific rashes we might need to think about blood testing and think if they were at that level yet ok
2422,2422,so uh but thats something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent pattern,so but thats something to bear in mind in this a pattern,so but thats something to bear in mind in this case a pattern

2851,2851,ok,ok,ok
2852,2852,all right um now um in terms of this headache uh obviously i havent been able to examine you or see you directly,right um terms this headache obviously been able to examine you or you,right um terms this headache has obviously not been able to examine you or you
2853,2853,but um it sounds like it might be one of two things it could be an element of what we call tension headache,but um it sounds like it be one of two it could an of what tension headache,but um it sounds like it could be one of two or more and it may be an indication of what tension headache is
2854,2854,ok thats one possibility um and what makes that more likely is the fact that youve been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past ok um,thats one um and what makes that more is the fact that under pressure you a of the past um,what makes that more difficult is the fact that under pressure you have a memory of the past um
2855,2855,the other possibility is um migraine as well,other possibility is um migraine as,other possibility is um migraine as well
2856,2856,ok um and the fact what makes that more likely is the fact that its on one side and that youve got some sensitivity to light,um and the fact what makes that more likely is the that its on one and that got sensitivity to light,what makes that more likely is the fact that its on one hand and that it got sensitivity to light
2857,2857,ok so what what i think we can do is um i think we can give you some um generic pain relief,ok i think we can do is we can you some pain relief,what we can do is we suggest that we give you some pain relief
2858,2858,that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches ok so ill tell you what it is in a second,that would be appropriate first type headaches ok so ill tell what it is a second,that would be appropriate for the first type of headaches ok so ill tell what it is for a second type
2859,2859,sure ok and um uh did the did the pain wake you up,sure and um did the did pain wake you up,sure and um did the pain wake you up
2860,2860,and the other thing that i was gonna suggest is we maybe look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work,the other was suggest maybe explore things to try and decrease the stress from work,the other was to suggest maybe explore other things to try and decrease the stress from work
2861,2861,so um the medication wise the things that wed start off first line if someone had migraine was to would be to start ibuprofen,um the medication the wed start off first line if had migraine was to would be to ibuprofen,um the medication the wed would start off first line if the patient had migraine and was unable to tolerate it would be added to ibuprofen
2862,2862,and um uh that the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses ibuprofen so thats one thing we can start you can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like but the the ibuprofens um actually more effective for migraine,and of ibuprofen be bit more than the normal doses ibuprofen so thats one thing we start on taking paracetamol well if like the the ibuprofens more for migraine,and the doses of ibuprofen may be a bit more than the normal doses for the treatment of migraine and postprandial hypertension so thats one thing if we start on taking paracetamol as well if like the general population the use of the prescribed acetaminophen  and the administration of other prescribed antihypertensive agents such as aspirin  is more effective for migraine
2863,2863,and um yeah so the the guidelines have changed recently we used we before that we used to give paracetamol as first line but now its um ibuprofen or aspirin,and um yeah so the the guidelines have changed we used we before that used to give as first line but now its um ibuprofen or aspirin,so the guidelines have changed we used we before that used to give aspirin as first line but now its um ibuprofen or aspirin
2864,2864,thats thing um the other thing id like you to do is maybe consider taking some time off work ok because if the headache is due to stress from work,thats the like to do maybe consider taking time ok the headache is due to stress,if the patient would like to do so maybe consider taking time ok if the headache is due to stress
2865,2865,um maybe having a week off if you self certify that might help with things and id also like you to explore counselling options as well so theres a counselling service in your area that i can give you the link for for you to self refer,maybe a week off if you self certify might help things and id also like to explore counselling options as well so theres a counselling service in your area i can give the for you to self,maybe a week off if you self certify might help things and id would also like to explore counselling options as well so that if theres a counselling service in your area i can give the best advice for you to self certify
2866,2866,id like you to ok id like you to try that um what were gonna do is well have a follow up in a weeks time,id you to id like you to try um what were gonna do is well have a follow up in a time,id you to id like you  to try um what were gonna do is well to have a follow up in a short time
2867,2867,as well as those two things other things id like you to do is to try and ensure that youre having a minimum of seven eight hours sleep at night every night and youre drinking a minimum of um one point five to two litres uh of water or fluids a day and thats not including coffee or tea,as well as two things like to do is and ensure that youre having a minimum of seven eight sleep and a of um one point five to two litres uh or fluids a day and not including or tea,one of the things to do is to observe and ensure that youre having a minimum of seven to eight hours of sleep and a maximum of um at one point five to two litres uh or fluids a day and not including water or tea
2868,2868,all right because sometimes dehydration and you know uh fatigue can be causes of headaches as well um,all because sometimes dehydration and you be causes of headaches well um,all because sometimes dehydration and vomiting can be causes of headaches as well um

4428,4428,normally when patients have this do some things number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because youre losing lots at the moment number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers so if you start getting a temperature then you need,normally when have some things number is to drink of water because youre losing lots at the two to out for any fevers so if start getting a temperature then you,normally when you have some things number one is to drink a lot of water because youre losing lots of fluids at the time of the two attempts to rule out for any fevers so if you start getting a temperature then you should drink more water

4438,4438,so the the things that youve told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had but if your things dont get worse then thats something that we can look up from the gp,so the the things that youve told are most suggestive of an of your and likely be something your but if your things get worse then thats something that look up the,so the things that youve told are most suggestive of an abnormality of your life and will likely be caused by something outside your control but if your things get worse then thats something that should look up in the literature
