118,118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do be deoxyadenosine_monophosphate faecal calprotectin indium which youve probably done before,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing best arranged to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before
119,119,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes,fair vitamin_A stool test to cheque for inflammation and the intestine therefore if thats high we might need to look astatine your medication and think about making some changes,fairly stool tests to cheque for inflammation and the intestine therefore if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes
120,120,do you have any questions about all of that quite a lot of information,do you receive any questions about all of that quite deoxyadenosine_monophosphate lot of information,do you have any questions about all of that quite a lot of information
121,121,yeah its okay if you do need to change my medication like what would be the next step,yeah information_technology okay if you do need to change my medication like what would be the future step,yeah it okay if you do need to change my medication like what would be the next step
122,122,so theres a few different options so there is a medication called and infliximab which is similar to adalimumab or we might look at you know switching you to a completely different drug um as well also also called the biologic different works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab but yeah i think first of all well get some up to date tests on first might need to get a ct scan or also an mri scan of your small bowel just to have a look and see if theres any inflammation in the bowel that might be you know causing your symptoms,so there A few different choice so there is a medication called and infliximab which is similar to adalimumab operating_room we might look astatine you know switching you to a wholly different drug um as well also also called the biologic different works Indiana a different way in the bodies it constitute called vedolizumab merely yea one think first of all well get some up to date tests on beginning might need to get A ct scan or also an magnetic_resonance_imaging scan of your humble intestine just to have a look and see if there any inflammation in the bowel that might exist you know causing your symptoms,so there is a medication called and infliximab which is similar to adalimumab or we might look at you know switching you to a completely different drug um as well also also called the biologic different works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab but yea one thinks first of all well get some up to date tests on first might need to get a ct scan or also an mri scan of your small intestine just to have a look and see if there any inflammation inthe bowel that might
123,123,and i had surgery before my treatment wasnt working do you think thats a possibility in the future,and one experience surgery earlier my treatment wasnt work do you think thats deoxyadenosine_monophosphate possibility Indiana the future,and one had surgery before my treatment wasnt done do you think thats a possibility in the future

208,208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,therefore yeah i think theres adenine few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some clock in fact not said to you shortly after you exist diagnose so we might need to expect at repeating that one think in the beginning case will perplex some lineage tests away to check in inflammatory marker and we need to send some sample of your fecal_matter off to lay_down sure there no infection and also send off a special stool test call fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation inch your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease I think depending on what those are well possibly decide on whether you indigence another camera test up up the tail end to have a expression at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you,therefore yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to expect at repeating that one thought in the first case will perplex some blood tests away to check in inflammatory markers and we needto send some samples of your stool off to make sure there no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease  I think depending
209,209,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in ,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all correct yeah i just yeah i didnt truly think could be get all these test and things quite a lot to take in,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all correct yeah i just so i didnt truly think could be get all these tests and things quite a lot to take in
210,210,of course,of course,of course
211,211,but yeah i understand ,merely yea one understand,merely yea understand
212,212,any other questions ,any other question,any other question
213,213,yeah do you think i need to change my medication to something else ,yeah do you think iodine need to change my medicine to something else,yeah do you think i need to change my medication to something else
214,214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,so one of the thing we can do is to check the level of the medication indium your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibody and the flush of the drug merely at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab merely until weve got deoxyadenosine_monophosphate bit More information about whats departure on,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of  the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibody and the levels of all the drugs but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your nalimaab but until weve got a bit more information about whats going on
215,215,okay you think i might need more surgery ,okay you think one might need more surgery,okay you think one might need more surgery
216,216,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay ,well again it count ampere little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might want to go on and get mri scan of your intestine just to have a look and make sure there arent any other point of narrowing in the bowel like you accept last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery merely thats A distribute further down the line for adenine moment okay,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we may want to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we would need to look at surgery but thats as far down the line for a moment okay
