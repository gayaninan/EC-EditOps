115,115,or what do you think,operating_room what do you think,operating what do you think
116,116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,yea so there a few things that might exist going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it can could be that happens the adalimumab kind test of lost its effectiveness which sometimes be happens and we can test for that by doing we a blood test to check for the level drug in body and also sometimes could develop antibodies against the drug equally well,yea so there a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of drug in the body and also sometimes we could develop antibodies against the drug as well
117,117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery the in reabsorbed the past that sometimes can get sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get get how reabsorbed surgery um and sometimes affect that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels bile salts in your bowel but thats quite to check for U well,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that sometimes can affect something called the bile salts get how reabsorbed surgery um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if you´ve got high levels of barium salts in your bowel but thats quite easy to check for us as well
118,118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,and of course you need to besides think about whether your disease is flaring actually flaring up as well so the up other thing well so arrange to a faecal in which youve probably before,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing can arrange to a faecal biopsy in which youve probably never been before
119,119,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes,just angstrom stool screen to cheque for inflammation and the need bowel so if thats high we might might need high to look your medication think about making some changes,just a stool test to check for inflammation and the need bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes

208,208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,so yeah i think there deoxyadenosine_monophosphate few different things it could be I notice that youve not suffer a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you curtly subsequently you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that iodine think in the foremost example will catch some blood tests special off check to check in theres inflammatory markers blood and we need to send some and samples of inflammation your stool off to special make sure bowel theres no infection called and also sure send inflammatory off bowel a special stool test called fecal in calprotectin check and thats to look for inflammation in to your bowel that some might be related to the crohns disease i depending what well maybe on whether you need another camera test up up the tail to a look at the lining of the bowel so i thats thats what doing how sound to you,so yeah i think there are a few different things it could be I notice that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you curtly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that iodine think in the foremost example will catch some blood tests off check to check in inflammatory markers and we needto send some samples of inflammation off to make sure bowel theres no infection called and also sure send inflammatory off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin check and thats how iodine is supposed to be used
209,209,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in ,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yea i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting these tests and things quite a lot take in,yeah i mean yes yeah thats all right yea i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting these tests and things quite a lot to take in

214,214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,so one of the things we buttocks do is to check the level of the medication in your blood checking called the adalimumab profile called or checking profile the antibodies and the the level of the drug at but of at the moment change you from your until got a bit more information whats going on,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of  the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the levels of drug but at the moment change you from your baseline until we got a bit more information about whats going on

216,216,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay ,well again information_technology depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go along and get mri scan of your bowel just to to the have a just look and and make narrowing sure of there arent any bowel other of points of narrowing there in the bowel a like you had time if thats the case might need to look at surgery but thats further down the a moment okay,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might have to go along and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like if you had more time if thats the case and might need to look at surgery but thats further down the line at a moment okay
