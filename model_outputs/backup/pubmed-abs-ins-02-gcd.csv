116,116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,yeah different so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only can need few different tests well so one of them youre right it could be that could the adalimumab kind also of sometimes lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the sometimes level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you um could develop antibodies against it the drug as well,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of sometimes lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drugs as well
117,117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and which can called make it ineffective so we can easily check it that and bowel the other thing us is that because youve had surgery in the past that can ineffective sometimes us affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um the and sometimes motions that can it cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to for check youve for us to well can,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that it cause diarrhoea if you´ve got high levels of biliary salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well
118,118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,and of course you need to also think about youve whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to is do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before other,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing youve to arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which weve probably done before
119,119,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes,just a thats stool might test to cheque for inflammation and the some bowel we so if your thats and high we might cheque need to look at need your the medication and think about making some changes,just a stool test might test for inflammation and the bowel so if your thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes
