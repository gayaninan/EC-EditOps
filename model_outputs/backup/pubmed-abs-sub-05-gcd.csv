208,208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,so yeah i think there A few different things it could embody one noticed that youve not had A colonoscopy for quite approximately time indium fact not state to you shortly after you were diagnose sol we might need to attend at repeating that iodine think in the first instance volition get_down some blood test off to check in inflammatory markers and we want to send some samples of your stool off to make sure there nobelium infection and besides send murder a particular stool test call fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your intestine that might be relate to the Crohn disease one think depending along what those are well possibly decide on whether you need another television_camera test up up the tail end to induce a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are do barely astatine that the moment how do that sound to you,so yeah i think there a few different things it could be one noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not stated to you shortly after you were diagnosed sol we might need to look at repeating that i thought in the first instance volition get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we want to send some samples of your stool off  to make sure there no infection and also send off a specific stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to search for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease one considers depending on what those are
209,209,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in ,yea i mean yes yea thats thats all justly yeah i equitable yea i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and thing quite a set to contract in,yea i mean yes yea thats all justly yeah i just mean yea i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and doing quite a set to contract in
210,210,of course,of course,of course
211,211,but yeah i understand ,merely yeah I understand,merely yeah I understand
212,212,any other questions ,any other questions,any other questions
213,213,yeah do you think i need to change my medication to something else ,yea do you think iodine need to change my medication to something else,yea do you think i need to change my medication to something else
214,214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,so one of the thing we buttocks perform be to check the flat of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or see the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment one wouldnt switch you from your adalimumab just until weve experience a spot more data about whats go on,so one of the things we can perform is to check the level of  the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or see the antibodies and the levels ofthe drugs but at the moment one wouldnt switch you from your adalinimumabs just until weve had a chance more data about whats go on
215,215,okay you think i might need more surgery ,okay you think i might need more surgery,okay you think i might need more surgery
216,216,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay ,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know count on what they show we might need to fail on and get magnetic_resonance_imaging scan of your intestine just to rich_person a look and make sure there arent any other point of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats deoxyadenosine_monophosphate distribute further down the line for adenine moment all_right,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depend on what they show we may need to fail on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we  might need  to look at surgery but thats a step further down the line for a moment just
