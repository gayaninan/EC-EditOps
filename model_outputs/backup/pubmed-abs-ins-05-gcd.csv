114,114,yeah im a bit worried just because its been so well controlled for few years now im worried that my is my adalimumab stopped working or is something else causing my symptoms,yeah yeah im a bit is worried been just because its been its so well my controlled for few controlled years now im worried is that because my is my im adalimumab now stopped working im or its is something else for causing my my symptoms,yeah yeah im a bit worried just because its been so well controlled for few years now im worried that because my im adalimumab stopped working or its something else causing my symptoms
115,115,or what do you think,or what what what do do you do think,or what do you think
116,116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,yeah so one theres different a sometimes few adalimumab things test that develop might the be check going on effectiveness to know which we be only doing need well few different which tests so drug one of against them youre right it could be that to the adalimumab kind different of can lost be its it effectiveness which that sometimes right happens and few we yeah can test of for that by as doing a the blood test that to check for the level for of know the drug in your few body and also test um right sometimes drug you a could develop sometimes antibodies also against the which drug going as few well that,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know which we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drugs as well
117,117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and that which can make past it had ineffective and so the we get can um easily check that that and the in other thing had is that because surgery youve had the surgery in levels the had past salts that can sometimes in affect how so something called the the bile if salts get something reabsorbed youve um of and sometimes that the can cause diarrhoea if youve check got it high salts levels easy of bile reabsorbed salts so in can your bowel motions diarrhoea but high thats quite can easy surgery to check check it for us well that,and so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that  can cause diarrhoea if you’ve got high levels  of biliary salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check it for us well
118,118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,and in of course you to need to also calprotectin think about whether your disease is disease actually flaring as up as well before so is the other thing faecal well think arrange to do is a you faecal youve calprotectin in up which probably youve a probably flaring done the before so,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin up which youve probably done before
119,119,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes,just a and stool test at to bowel cheque for inflammation and about the and bowel to so if thats high test we to might need to a look just at your need medication and think about making some changes,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes
120,120,do you have any questions about all of that quite a lot of information,do lot you have any questions quite about all about of have that quite questions a have lot all of questions information,do you have any questions about all of that quite a lot of information
121,121,yeah its okay if you do need to change my medication like what would be the next step,yeah medication its okay its if change you do do need what to change my would medication change like what would be the next step,yeah its okay if you do need to change my medication like what would be the next step
122,122,so theres a few different options so there is a medication called and infliximab which is similar to adalimumab or we might look at you know switching you to a completely different drug um as well also also called the biologic different works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab but yeah i think first of all well get some up to date tests on first might need to get a ct scan or also an mri scan of your small bowel just to have a look and see if theres any inflammation in the bowel that might be you know causing your symptoms,so a theres small a look few different your options inflammation so look there is some a we medication called and infliximab so which bowel is in similar to adalimumab different or we of might look on at theres you scan know called switching you symptoms to know a that completely different or drug bowel um as um well also also as called to the and biologic get different um works date in a different different small way look in the bodies also it know is inflammation called scan vedolizumab also but yeah i think first of switching all works well any get any some biologic up to date tests well on similar first theres might need a to get get a ct you scan switching or just also an in mri scan in of your date small well bowel yeah just to a have a look and and see a if mri theres of any inflammation in the is bowel that might be yeah you way know called causing ct your completely symptoms,so a small look few different options so there is a medication called infliximab which is similar to adalimumab or we might look on theres you know switching symptoms to a completely different drug um as well also called to the biologic get um works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab but yeah i think first of all works well get any up to date tests
