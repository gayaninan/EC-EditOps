115,115,or what do you think,or what do or you do think,or what do you think
116,116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,yeah your so theres kind a few things test that might be for going on to know we only need drug few different tests by so one one of tests them youre right it to could and be few that be the adalimumab kind we of lost them its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we we can test for that by doing a blood test in to right check for the the level of the drug a in your body need and which also yeah um to sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug sometimes as level well the,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check the level of the drug in your body and also um to sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drugs as well
117,117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and which can make it cause ineffective so we can can easily check that and so the other high thing is that because youve had salts surgery in the past that can it sometimes affect how something called the can bile well salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of make bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy ineffective to motions check for us well,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and so the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that  can cause diarrhoea if you´ve got high levels of sodium salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us
118,118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,and of think course you need your to also think about so whether arrange your thing disease is actually flaring also up to as well so the other thing well well and arrange to and do the is a also faecal need calprotectin in faecal which other youve probably done thing before other,and of course you need to think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done this before
119,119,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes,just a stool and test to cheque for inflammation cheque and if the bowel so if thats at high high we stool might test need a to making look at your the medication and think so about stool making some changes to,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and if the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes
