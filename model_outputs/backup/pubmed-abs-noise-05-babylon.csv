3158,3158,right ok it could you know generally for you know for underactive thyroids what symptoms youve said um its the opposite that usually happens yeah its for overactive thyroid like you can feel a bit like the racing of your heart beat and all so im not quite clear on what picture we are having here yeah,right ok it could you know generally for you know for underactive thyroid_gland what symptoms youve state um its the opposite that bit usually its happens yeah the its that for bit overactive the thyroid can like you that can feel its a bit like opposite the a racing of your heart beat and all im not quite clear on are here,right ok it could you know generally for you known for underactive thyroid what symptoms youve state um its the opposite that usually happens yeah its that for overactive the thyroid can like you can feel a bit like the racing of your heart beat and all im not quite clear on which symptoms are here
3159,3159,i think a general set of bloods is a good good start so what we look at because youre not youre not having the umph arent you youre like youre just feeling a bit you know low and things like that right well um and weak and things like that so well just do a general set of bloods we look at things like anaemia how your kidney functions are your livers all that with vitamin levels and your,i think adenine general dress of bloods is a good good start so what we look at because youre not youre not having the umph arent you well youre know like youre and just know feeling a bit you just know that low and things like that right right well and um and weak like and things and like that and so well feeling general of we at like anaemia functions livers that vitamin levels your,what we look at because youre not having the umph arent you well know like you are and just know a bit you know that low things like right um and weak things and like that and so feeling general of we at like anaemia functions like livers that are low vitamin levels and your blood pressure
3160,3160,ok and uh now after we get those set of bloods we will find out if we can find anything in them if thats all clear then we would need to do a physical examination ok,all_right and uh now after we make those set of blood we will in find if out if if anything we anything can can find we anything in in them if thats we all clear would to physical examination,all right uh now after we make those sets of blood we will find out if we can find anything in them if thats all clear and we would like to perform a physical examination
3161,3161,we would need to then go in and do but theres nothing from what your history youve said that that we urgently warrant a physical examination at this point in time i think its a good idea to start off with a blood test and then take it from there,we would need to then go in and perform merely there nothing from what your history youve said urgently that in that we urgently warrant i a that physical examination at this this point youve in examination time warrant i a and then take it from there,we would need nothing from what your history youve said urgently that we warrant a physical examination at this point in time i would then take it from there
