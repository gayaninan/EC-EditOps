77,77,okay so your stool cultures have been negative so thats the exclude any infective cause of your diarrhoea and obviously youve had your colonoscopy and we took some biopsy results and so that sort of confirms the diagnosis of something something called ulcerative colitis which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease i dont know if youve heard of those terms before ,okay so been negative so the exclude infective cause your and youve had colonoscopy we some results that of confirms the diagnosis something something called colitis is a of dont know if youve of those before,the results exclude the infective cause of your symptoms and if youve had colonoscopy we have some results that of course confirms the diagnosis of something called ulcerative colitis but there is a lack of evidence and we dont know if weve seen any of those before

79,79,okay so its sort of chronic inflammatory disease affecting predominantly the bowel but it can affect other parts of the body like skin joints sometimes even the eyes um but thats more unusual um so we were planned to start you on some steroids initially to try and reduce the inflammation down and also medication called pentasa which is a maintenance therapy um so have you had any steroids at all yet from your gp or ,so its disease but affect the skin sometimes but thats more unusual so we were planned start you on steroids to try and reduce the called which a maintenance um you had any at all yet from your or,so its disease but it can affect the skin sometimes but thats more unusual so we were planned to start you on steroids to try and reduce the toxicity called um which is a maintenance um if you had any symptoms at all yet from your body or mind

82,82,so everyones a little bit different in terms of how their disease course progresses um some people are you know very well controlled on therapy for for years and some people have a bit more of a rough ride and require other medications to be added in as well so well keep you on it for you know at least the first year or so and then well review things after that and but also with colitis is a chronic long term condition that youll have for the rest of your life and have to sort of learn to live with as well but theres lots of support available for you as well so ,so everyones a little bit in how their disease course um people well controlled for and have bit more of a rough other added in as well you on for know least the first year or then things that but also a long term condition have for the of of learn to live with as well but theres lots of for as well so,everyones have a little bit of experience in how their disease course progresses um people are well controlled for their illness and have quite a bit more of a rough road than other diseases added in as well as you have to be on medication for at least the first year or then things that are important but also a long term condition have become important for the care of the patients and of people who learn to live with these problems also but theres lots of other problems for them too so

111,111,um ive lost a wee bit of weight actually,um ive lost a wee of weight,um ive lost a wee bit of weight
112,112,yeah okay,yeah,yeah
113,113,and so do you have any sort of ideas what might be going on yourself or any concerns at this point,and so you have on any concerns at this point,and so you have no information on any concerns at this point
114,114,yeah im a bit worried just because its been so well controlled for few years now im worried that my is my adalimumab stopped working or is something else causing my symptoms,yeah im a bit worried because so controlled few years im worried that is stopped working something causing my symptoms,yeah im a bit worried because so controlled over the last few years im worried that my brain is stopped working or something causing my symptoms
115,115,or what do you think,or you,or you
116,116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,so theres a few that might be going to know we need few tests one them youre that the adalimumab lost which sometimes happens and can for that by a blood to check the your and um could against drug as well,there are a few things that might be going to know and we need to perform few tests one of them is youre that the adalimumab is lost which sometimes happens and can be used for that reason by performing a blood test to check the effectiveness of your drug and um could be against drug as well
117,117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and which make we can easily and other that because youve in the past that sometimes affect how bile salts sometimes that can diarrhoea if youve levels salts in your bowel but quite easy for us,and which make us believe that we can easily diagnose and treat other diseases that because youve been exposed to bile salts in the past that sometimes affect how much of the bowel is metabolized by barium salts and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if there are low levels of salts or in your bowel but quite easy for us to diagnose
118,118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,and of need to also about as well so the well do a faecal calprotectin which youve probably,and of course we need to also know about calprotectin as well so that the well can do a better job of preventing faecal cal Protectin which youve probably already done
119,119,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes,just a stool test cheque inflammation and bowel so high we need at your and think about making,however because the incidence of stool test cheque inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease is so high we need to look at your symptoms and think about making a decision
120,120,do you have any questions about all of that quite a lot of information,do you have any questions all of that a lot information,all of that is a lot of information
121,121,yeah its okay if you do need to change my medication like what would be the next step,its if you do need my medication like what next,its unclear if you do need my medication like what next
122,122,so theres a few different options so there is a medication called and infliximab which is similar to adalimumab or we might look at you know switching you to a completely different drug um as well also also called the biologic different works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab but yeah i think first of all well get some up to date tests on first might need to get a ct scan or also an mri scan of your small bowel just to have a look and see if theres any inflammation in the bowel that might be you know causing your symptoms,so a few options a infliximab is similar to we at you know you to completely different as also called biologic different works in in the bodies is yeah i first get up tests on might to get ct scan also an mri just look and see if theres any inflammation in the bowel be causing symptoms,in a few options a infliximab is similar to a ct scan but we at you know that you have to be completely different as it is also called biologic and different works in different areas in the different bodies is yeah i first get up and perform tests on it might be time to get an abdominal xray cct scan and also an mri just look and see if theres any inflammation or if it may be causing symptoms
123,123,and i had surgery before my treatment wasnt working do you think thats a possibility in the future,and i surgery before my treatment wasnt do you think a possibility future,and i had surgery before my treatment was discontinued do you think there is a possibility of future complications
124,124,so i mean its always possible we have to always keep it at the back of our mind and hopefully they you know we can try and work out whats going on and that do something medically but yeah ofcourse we have to always think about surgery is as a possibility,so i mean its possible we have to always keep it the of our mind hopefully they we try and whats and that but yeah we to is as a possibility,we have to always keep it in the back of our mind and hopefully they understand that we try and understand whats and what is this and that but yeah we need to treat it as a possibility
125,125,yeah but hopefully not,yeah but hopefully,yeah but hopefully not yet
126,126,yes definitely okay,definitely,definitely

158,158,no i dont think so ,no i,no i
159,159,okay so so far youve had some investigations done so weve taken some samples of your stool to make sure that theres no infection there and you also had a colonoscopy a couple of weeks ago did anyone go through the results with you ,okay so youve some investigations weve taken some samples of your make sure that theres infection there and you had a colonoscopy a couple did anyone go through results with,weve taken some samples of your colon to make sure that theres no infection there and you had a colonoscopy a couple years ago did anyone go through the results with me
160,160,no not really no ,no not no,no not no
161,161,so that we took some biopsies when we did the colonoscopy and it looks like you do have something called ulcerative colitis okay so they were in keeping with with that condition i dont know how much you know about inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis ,so took some we did the and looks like something called colitis so they with with that condition i know how you know about bowel ulcerative,so we did the histopathological examination and it looks like something called ulcerative colitis so they are diagnosed with a history with that condition and i know how you know about bowel perforation and anorectal bleeding due to a possible gastroduodenoscopy or anastomosis
162,162,i know wee bit because i have seen my grandma my grandfather had it i dont know i dont know a lot ,wee i have seen my grandma my it i know know lot,wee i have seen my grandma and my mom and it i know know a lot about her
163,163,okay so its what we call a chronic condition so its something that youre going to have life long unfortunately um but its a condition that we can control very well with medications in the vast majority of people so to start with well start you on a course of steroids i dont think youve had any from your gp yet but that should help to sort of calm down the inflammation in your bowel and then well get you started on some other maintenance therapies im going into details of that on at the next consultation do you have any questions about that just at the moment ,okay so we a chronic so that youre going to have life long but its a condition that we can very in the majority of to with well start on a course i dont think youve had gp yet but should help to sort of calm down the in your bowel and then well get you other therapies going into of that on next consultation do you any questions that at the moment,we have a chronic constipation so that youre going to have life long symptoms but its a condition that we can very effectively treat in the majority of patients due to its association with a well start on a therapeutic course i dont think youve had a gp yet but it should help to sort of calm down the pain in your bowel and then then well get you other therapies going into the course of that on the next consultation do you have any questions that are relevant at the moment
164,164,um so um yeah sorry its just lot to take in ,um um yeah just lot to in,um um yeah there was just a lot to do in this area
165,165,so how long will be on these steroids for is that for lifelong ,so how will be on these is for lifelong,however how much work will be done on these issues is unknown for lifelong followup
166,166,so the steroids are normally just for 8 to 68 weeks until the inflammation has has died down ,are just for 8 weeks the has died,in just for 8 weeks the patient has died
167,167,and hopefully your bowel have it should be going back to normal,and your bowel should going normal,and your bowel sounds should be going normal
168,168,and you should know its less blood as well if that doesnt happen with the steroids then we would want to know about that in case we need to do some further investigations but in terms of maintenance therapies that we talked about you will be on those for longer term and often people are on them lifelong or certainly for years depending on the course of their disease ,and you its blood as well if that happen with steroids then know about that in case we need do some further investigations but of maintenance that about will be on those for term often people are on them lifelong or certainly for depending the course of their,and if that does happen with steroids then we should know about that in case we need to do some further investigations but if of maintenance that is about to be done on those steroids for the long term often people are on them for lifelong or certainly for a long time depending on the course of their life
169,169,okay so and well also have to arrange some surveillance colonoscopy for you as well just to make sure that you dont develop other conditions that are associated with inflammatory bowel disease okay ,and well to arrange for as to make that you conditions associated inflammatory okay,it is well advised to arrange for an emergency operation as to make sure that you are aware of conditions associated with inflammatory okay
170,170,so well arrange it to see you back in clinic in about six weeks time for a review thank you,so well arrange to see back in in six weeks a review you,so well arrange to see you back in six weeks with a review of the literature available to you

203,203,id say so ,id say so,id does not say so
204,204,have you noticed any stomach upset with that ,noticed any with that,we never noticed any difference with that score
205,205,i mean well i suppose i have to have this abdominal pain in my tummy so i dont know could that be could be connected to that,i mean suppose have have pain so that could that,we mean that we suppose children have a tendency to have pain so that could explain that
206,206,yeah possibly so we do find people here on long term nonsteroidal medications like diclofenac that kind of upset your stomach especially if youre not taking omeprazole or a medication like that with it so we need to be might need to address that do you have any insight or ideas about what might be causing your symptoms preferably the diarrhoea and the weight loss ,yeah possibly so we on long term nonsteroidal medications diclofenac kind your stomach especially if not taking or a medication it we need need that do you any ideas about be causing preferably diarrhoea and weight loss,yeah possibly so we recommend on long term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications diclofenac kind of drugs for your stomach especially if you are not taking or taking a medication it we need to need that do you have any ideas about what might be causing them preferably diarrhoea and weight loss
207,207,and well i suppose i just assumed thats my crohns with that was being watery but i dont know about but do you think it could be anything else ,i i just assumed thats my that being dont know about but you think it,its my experience that being human i dont know about it but you think it is
208,208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,yeah theres a few different things it could i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy quite said shortly after you were diagnosed might need look think in the first instance some blood off to check in and we need to send samples your stool off make sure infection send a special test called fecal calprotectin to look for in your that be to the disease think depending on what those well maybe whether you another camera test up the tail to have a the lining think thats what are just the moment does,however it could be that i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy quite often said shortly after you were diagnosed that we might need to look for it and think in the first instance some blood tests off to check in and we need also to send samples of your stool off and make sure that the infection is detected and send a special test called fecal calprotectin to try for any abnormalities in your colon that might be related to the disease think depending on what those are well maybe whether you need another camera test up the tail to have a scan of the lining think thats what are just the moment does not matter
209,209,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in ,i mean yeah thats all yeah i just yeah didnt really think getting these tests and quite a lot to in,all yeah i just yeah didnt really think about getting these tests and quite a lot of them seem to be useful in some cases
210,210,of course,of course,of course
211,211,but yeah i understand ,but yeah i,but yeah i
212,212,any other questions ,other questions,other questions were addressed
213,213,yeah do you think i need to change my medication to something else ,do you think i need to my medication something,do you think i need to take my medication or something
214,214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,so one the things we is check the in blood the checking the antibodies the of drug the change you your until weve more about going on,one of the things we do is check the changes in blood pressure and the blood count by checking the antibodies the type of drug the change in you and your family until weve learned more about what is going on
215,215,okay you think i might need more surgery ,you think might need,however you think that the patient might need further followup
216,216,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay ,well again it bit the might you know depending what show we might need to go on and get mri scan of bowel to have a look and make any points of narrowing in the bowel had time if thats the case then we might need to at surgery but thats a lot further down line a okay,well again it is a bit of the same but you know depending on what we show we might need to go on and get a mri scan of bowel to have a look and make any points of narrowing in the bowel that had been seen at the time of surgery and if thats the case then it might be needed to be made at surgery but thats a lot further down line than a okay

255,255,okay so at the moment we need to take some stool cultures from you i think youve had some sent but we need to send a couple more just to exclude any infection we also need to arrange an urgent colonoscopy for you so that im sure your mom have had one of those before so its basically a camera test it goes into your bowel and has a look and we take photographs and take biopsies to try and diagnose you with what we think is inflammatory bowel disease okay there are a couple of different types of inflammatory bowel disease so one is called ulcerative colitis like your mom has and the other one is called crohns disease and so they are similar in many ways but there are key differences in terms of how we manage people so thats what well do at the moment for today well start you on something called pentesia which is to try and help reduce any inflammation in the bowel and then once we get a formal diagnosis from biopsies and things well hopefully aim to start you on some steroids to reduce the inflammation okay does that sound okay ,at moment we need to take some stool cultures had sent we couple to exclude any infection also to arrange an colonoscopy you that your have had of before so its basically a test it into your bowel has a and we take photographs and biopsies to and what think bowel disease okay are a of different of is colitis and the other one crohns so they similar in but there differences in terms of people so thats what well do at today well start you which is help reduce inflammation in the bowel once get formal diagnosis biopsies and things start you on to reduce the inflammation sound,we need to take some stool cultures which had been sent to a couple of laboratories to exclude any infection and also to arrange an colonoscopy for you so that your doctor can have had a history of this disease before so its basically a test to determine whether it is transferred into your bowel and has a clinical significance and we take photographs and biopsies to test and what do we think of bowel disease okay there are a number of different types of crohns disease so they are similar in appearance but there were differences in terms of people so what we do what well do at today well start you which is help reduce inflammation in
256,256,yeah that sounds okay ,yeah that okay,yeah that was okay
257,257,do you have any questions about all of that or ,do you have any questions of or,do you have any questions of tolerance or tolerance
258,258,so do i have to be on medications forever ,do to,do not underestimate the importance of gut microbiota in relation to health
259,259,so its very dependent on the patient or on the person who some people respond very well to initial therapy and they might remain well for years with a normal bowel habit and will kind of see you or speak to you from clinic you know maybe every six months for a year to see how youre getting on and decides if you can come off medication so some people stay on medication lifelong and some people manage to come off it ,so on patient or on who people very well initial might well with a normal habit will kind of see to you from you know every six months for a to how youre getting on and decides if you come off so people stay on medication some people manage to come off it,so depending on the patient or on who people are very well after initial treatment they might be well with a normal habit and will kind of see to you from the beginning you know every six months for a year to see how youre getting on and decides if you come off medication so people stay on medication and some people manage to stay off it
