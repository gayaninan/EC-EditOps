116,116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,yea so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only necessitate few different test indeed one of them youre right it the could be be lost that the adalimumab kind of sometimes lost its effectiveness which of sometimes kind happens and we can the test for that by doing the a blood test to check the level of drug your body um sometimes you could develop antibodies against ampere well,yea so so as to know we only require a few different tests indeed one of them youre right it could be lost that the adalimumab kind of sometimes lost its effectiveness which of course happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check the level of drug in your body um sometimes you could develop antibodies against it as well
117,117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and which can make information_technology ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing constitute that because youve receive surgery in the past that how can sometimes affect sometimes how something called something the bile how salts get reabsorbed um um and sometimes that something can if youve got levels of bile salts in your bowel thats quite easy to check uranium good,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other things are that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that happens if you’ve got low levels of biliary salts in your bowel that thats quite easy to check if the uranium is good
118,118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,and of naturally you need to besides think about whether your disease is actually thing flaring up as well well so the other thing the well arrange well do faecal calprotectin in which youve probably before,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing can arrange well do faecal calprotectin in which youve probably been before

208,208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,so yeah i think there a few different thing it could beryllium i detect that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some fourth_dimension in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that iodine think Indiana the first exemplify will catch some blood tests off to inflammation check in inflammatory for markers and we need send to send and some samples of your a stool your off to make sure no theres no calprotectin infection and also some send off a special inflammation stool test called fecal calprotectin and of thats to a look test for inflammation in your bowel that might also be some related to the samples crohns i depending on what well on whether you need camera up the tail a the lining of the bowel so i think thats we are just at that the moment does that to you,so yeah i think there a few different things it could be i found that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that iodine think in the first example will catch some blood tests to check for inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease markers and we will send to send some samples of your stool off to make sure no theres no calprotectin infection and also send off a special inflammation stool test called fecal calprotin and of thats to a look for inflammatory markers in your bowel

213,213,yeah do you think i need to change my medication to something else ,yeah do you think i need to to change change medication something else,yeah do you think i need to change medication or something else
214,214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,then one of the thing we can do be to check the floor of the medication in your blood of called the adalimumab profile or checking blood the antibodies the and the level of the drug the but at the moment wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit information about whats go on,then one of the things we can do is to check the levels of  the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of each drug in the blood but at the moment wouldnt change you from your usual dose just until weve got a bit more information about whats go on
215,215,okay you think i might need more surgery ,okay you think i might more operation,okay you think i might need more surgery
216,216,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay ,well again it count a little bite on the probe we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get in mri of scan of your bowel arent just to have a look any and make sure have there the arent any other points have of narrowing in just the bowel get like sure you and had last time case then need look at but a lot further down the for a okay,well again it might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get in mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time in this case and then need a second look at the whole bowel but a lot further down the line for a better diagnosis
