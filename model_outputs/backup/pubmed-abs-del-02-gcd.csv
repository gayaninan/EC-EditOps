115,115,or what do you think,or what do you think,or what do you think
116,116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,yeah theres a few things that might be going on know we need few different tests so one them right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost sometimes happens we can test for that by doing blood test check for the level of the drug your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,yeah theres a few things that might be going on we know we need few different tests so one of them is right it could be that the adalimumab is kind of lost sometimes happens we can test for that by doing blood test check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the antiretroviral drug as well
117,117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and which make it ineffective we can check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery the past that sometimes affect something salts get um that can cause diarrhoea youve got levels of bile salts motions thats quite easy to for us well,and which make it ineffective we can check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that sometimes affect something bile salts get um that can cause diarrhoea and because weve got high levels of biliary salts motions thats quite easy to check for us as well
118,118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is flaring up well so the other thing well do is a calprotectin in which youve probably before,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is flaring up as well so the other thing well do is a calprotectin therapy in which youve probably done it before
119,119,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes,stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to at your medication and making some changes,stool test is a cheque for inflammation and the inflammatory bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and making some changes
120,120,do you have any questions about all of that quite a lot of information,do you have any questions about all of that a lot of information,all of that requires a lot of information

208,208,so yeah i think theres a few different things it could be i noticed that youve not had a colonoscopy for quite some time in fact not said to you shortly after you were diagnosed so we might need to look at repeating that i think in the first instance will get some blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of your stool off to make sure theres no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal calprotectin and thats to look for inflammation in your bowel that might be related to the crohns disease i think depending on what those are well maybe decide on whether you need another camera test up up the tail end to have a look at the lining of the bowel so i think thats thats what we are doing just at that the moment how does that sound to you ,so i think theres a few different things it could i that youve not had colonoscopy for quite some time fact not said to shortly after diagnosed we might need to look at repeating that i in the first instance will get blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and we need to send some samples of stool off to make sure no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal and thats to look for in your that be related to the crohns disease i depending what are well maybe decide on you another test up up the tail end have a look at the the bowel so i think thats what we are doing just at that the moment does sound to you,therefore in a few different things it could be i that youve not had colonoscopy for quite some time in fact it is not said to occur shortly after diagnosed we might need to look at repeating that i in the first instance will get blood tests off to check in inflammatory markers and then i will send some samples of stool off again to make sure there is no infection and also send off a special stool test called fecal biopsy and that might be related to the crohns disease i depending on what are well maybe we decide on you another test up up the tail end and have a close look of the bowel
209,209,yeah i mean yes yeah thats thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt really think could be getting all these tests and things quite a lot to take in ,i yes yeah thats all right yeah i just yeah i didnt think be all these things a lot to take in,i just yeah i didnt think it would be all these things a lot to take in

213,213,yeah do you think i need to change my medication to something else ,yeah do you think i need change my to something else,yeah do you think i need to change my diet to something else
214,214,so one of the things we can do is to check the level of the medication in your blood called the adalimumab profile or checking the antibodies and the level of the drug but at the moment i wouldnt change you from your adalimumab just until weve got a bit more information about whats going on ,one of things we can do is to check the level of the in your blood called the adalimumab profile checking the and the of the drug but the moment i wouldnt you your adalimumab until got bit more about going on,one of the things we can do is to check the level of a drug in your blood called the adalimumab profile checking the efficacy and the tolerability of both the drug but at the moment i wouldnt know about your use of acarbose and antiretroviral therapy until i got bit more anxious about what was going on
215,215,okay you think i might need more surgery ,okay you think i might more surgery,okay you think i might need more surgery
216,216,well again it depends a little bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what they show we might need to go on and get mri scan of your bowel just to have a look and make sure there arent any other points of narrowing in the bowel like you had last time if thats the case then we might need to look at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay ,well again it depends a bit on the investigations we might you know depending on what show we need to go and get scan of bowel just to have a and there arent any other of narrowing in the bowel had last if thats the case then we might need to at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay,well again it depends a bit on the investigations we might have to let you know depending on what investigations show we need to go and get a scan of the bowel just to have a look and there arent any other cases of narrowing in the small bowel that had been reported last year if thats the case then we may need further investigations at surgery but thats a lot further down the line for a moment okay
