3819,3819,ok so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of things thats easily digested like what we are good give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple food for babies you dont give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding so thats the kind of soft diet were talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of it in you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash,all_right so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of thing thats easily digested like what we are good give baby yeah when they start eating you give simple food for child you dont sacrifice eggs or kernel the first time they start feed so thats the kind of soft diet were talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of information_technology in you can begin off with some just boil vegetables and mash,so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of things thats easily digested like what we are good giving baby yeah when they start eating you give simple food for children you dont sacrifice eggs or nuts the first time they starts feeding so thats the kind  of soft diet were talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of it in you can begin off with some just boil vegetables and mash
3820,3820,once youre ok with that for about forty eight hours then you can start having meat so just dont have meat once you feel like youre slightly better because you might go back to square one again all right,once youre very_well with that for approximately forty eight hours then you can start having meat so good dont have kernel once you feel like youre slightly better because you might go back to feather one again all right,once youre very comfortable with that for approximately forty eight hours then you can start having meat so good dont have heart once you feel like you are slightly better because you might go back to eating one again all right
