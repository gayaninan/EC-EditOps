112,112,yeah okay,yeah okay okay,yeah okay
113,113,and so do you have any sort of ideas what might be going on yourself or any concerns at this point,and yourself so do you have any do sort of ideas yourself what ideas might be you going yourself on yourself or any or concerns at ideas this or point,and so do you have any sort of idea what might be going on yourself or any concerns at this point
114,114,yeah im a bit worried just because its been so well controlled for few years now im worried that my is my adalimumab stopped working or is something else causing my symptoms,yeah im a bit else worried so just working because my its is been so well controlled my for so few that years now its im worried that my is my adalimumab stopped working or is worried something else causing my symptoms worried,yeah im a bit worried just because its been so well controlled for so few years now im worried that my adalimumab stopped working or is something else causing my symptoms
115,115,or what do you think,or what do you think think,or what do you think
116,116,yeah so theres a few things that might be going on to know we only need few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that the adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um sometimes you could develop antibodies against the drug as well,yeah so theres a only few which things that might a be of going on to know we need only drug need so few different be tests kind so you one of them kind youre right it effectiveness could be that the adalimumab kind of for lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens be and we can test that for that by as doing a to blood yeah test to check happens for yeah the level to of the drug in of your body also and also um sometimes you could going develop antibodies level against develop the drug sometimes as well of,yeah so theres only few things that might be going on to know we need only so few different tests so one of them youre right it could be that adalimumab kind of lost its effectiveness which sometimes happens and we can test that for that by doing a blood test to check for the level of the drug in your body and also um you could develop antibodies against the drugs as well
117,117,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and sometimes that can cause diarrhoea if youve got high levels of bile salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us well,and which can make it we ineffective so we but can easily check that and the other thing it is in that other because salts youve um had surgery got in the and past is that cause can sometimes affect can how we something called thats the bile of salts surgery get reabsorbed ineffective um and sometimes that that can cause for diarrhoea if youve got high can levels can of bile salts in affect your well bowel motions but high thats quite easy to check for us and well,and which can make it ineffective so we can easily check that and the other thing it is that because youve had surgery in the past that can sometimes affect how something called the bile salts get reabsorbed um and that that  can cause diarrhoea if you’ve got high levels of sodium salts in your bowel motions but thats quite easy to check for us and well
118,118,and of course you need to also think about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing well arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before,and youve of about course actually you well need youve to think also think youve about whether of your disease is actually flaring up as well actually so actually the other thing well arrange need to do is a to faecal do calprotectin in which youve probably to done before,and of course you need to think also about whether your disease is actually flaring up as well so the other thing arrange to do is a faecal calprotectin in which youve probably done before
119,119,just a stool test to cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes,just the a stool test to cheque for inflammation thats and the a bowel the so if if thats high might we think might need to look at at your thats medication at and think bowel about making at some changes changes a,just a stool test cheque for inflammation and the bowel so if thats high we might need to look at your medication and think about making some changes
120,120,do you have any questions about all of that quite a lot of information,do you have any all questions about about all all of quite that quite quite a lot of information,do you have any questions about all of that quite a lot of information
121,121,yeah its okay if you do need to change my medication like what would be the next step,yeah its next okay if do you the do what need to do change step my if medication like what would okay be the next would step,yeah its okay if you do need to change my medication like what would be the next step
122,122,so theres a few different options so there is a medication called and infliximab which is similar to adalimumab or we might look at you know switching you to a completely different drug um as well also also called the biologic different works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab but yeah i think first of all well get some up to date tests on first might need to get a ct scan or also an mri scan of your small bowel just to have a look and see if theres any inflammation in the bowel that might be you know causing your symptoms,so as theres some a in few to different small options so there is vedolizumab a medication called and infliximab which is similar to adalimumab or we there might look so at medication you know switching to you to yeah a completely different few drug um or as tests well also also called have the biologic different mri works in in a need different way in to the in bodies it is called vedolizumab but yeah which i think first look of first all well look get ct some up to date tests on first the might need get to get a ct scan or so also an look mri scan see of your tests small bowel to just options to have a look and see if theres any to inflammation in the i bowel that might be you adalimumab know causing i your symptoms,so as theres a few different small options so there is a medication called infliximab which is similar to adalimumab or we might look at you switching you to a completely different drug um or as well also have the biologic mri works in a different way in the bodies it is called vedolizumab but yeah i think first of all well get some up to date tests on the need to get a ct scan
123,123,and i had surgery before my treatment wasnt working do you think thats a possibility in the future,and before i you had possibility surgery do before my in treatment you wasnt my working do surgery you thats think thats a possibility in the future the,and before i had surgery before my treatment you wasnt working do surgery you think thats a possibility in the future
